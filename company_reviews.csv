Not Employee Friendly
Wipro is not Employee Friendly.
An employee cannot grow financially here.
Most of the policies are constructed for the benefit of Wipro and not for Employee.

Wide range of projects
Notice period is 3 months
The work-life balance and the technology totally depends on the projects you get into.
Risky to stay on bench. Get into a project asap

Good
The team and project was good. Depends on project and team. Could not learn much as a fresher buy overall it was good experience. Salary is not competitive and less hike.

Good work life balance
No pressure at work, wonderful team and supportive manager. Manager checks with the team members on bandwidth before he assigns work. We can take as many as planned leaves.

workplace culture
workplace culture.
Nice company to work and good work life balance and all depends on the project you are working on.
management.
Management is good up to some extent.

Pretty relaxing Environment
There are many learning opportunities here at Wipro, I myself got cloud certified and worked on cloud projects and that’s been phenomenal in boosting my career.

nice
If you are a fresher and hardly have any technical skills or not from the elite colleges like IITs but have a very strong analytical abilities and communication skills then this job is definitely for you.

Initially for the first two years you will feel insecured about career as you would hardly have gained any technical experience but definitely alot of maturity in terms of dealing with challenging situations. If you hunt for jobs with that profile, at the max you would land in a BPO with little increment in salary but trust you would miss Amazon since there cannot be any better profiles or organisation for category of roles. To conclude, you have almost no market value at this point of time unless you opt to move into a BPO

All good only bench time issue = 45 days
Salary is on time and 20 K extra for medical bill.
Over all company is good.
Project can be changed after 18 month
My manager is very supporting
3 day work from office.

20 K extra for medical bills.
bench time 45 days only
Excellent
What is the best part of working at the company?
Good working environment with colleagues and management.

Amazon fun place to work with
At Amazon, learnt many things about e-commerce, how customers buy and sell online. And how important customers are for the company. Learnt the full meaning of Customer is the King. Cool company to work with.

Dell the biggest computer company, Work culture was really awesome and the management, colleagues and the company as a whole was really great.When I joined Dell i knew nothing about computers and peripherals. While I was leaving Dell i knew much troubleshooting. Thanks to Dell.

Genpact, what can i say about this company. Dream company to work with. Awesome staff, wide range of learning tools.

Good company to work for
Amazon is best place to learn. It has good cool culture like no formal dress code , good employee behavior. Amazon has world best mind working here so if you are the one who is willing to learn is the best place. We have so many groups where you can learn more then your job profile required. We are up to date with all new technologies. It welcome global employee growth with good salary. You can expect little work pressure but overall it is wonderful place.

In Amazon it feels like Day 1 everyday ❤️
Amazon is not just a company it's an emotion. Once you join you feel that you belong there. The workplace is comfortable and people are friendly. Company gives many benefits to the employees and lots of fun activities are conducted. Also a platform for multiple growth opportunities to grow within the organization. I am glad that I worked in Amazon and I wish to join again if I get a chance.

Meal Allowance, Transport Allowance, no dress code, sufficient leave, transparency
No cons
Great work culture but targets oriented
The work culture is amazing and the salary is also higher compared to other companies. But the job Is target based, and those targets keep on increasing every quarter.

Working at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer (SDE)
Working at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) has been an incredible journey. The dynamic environment fosters innovation and collaboration, allowing for continuous professional growth. The emphasis on customer-centric solutions is inspiring, driving us to create impactful products. The vast scale of projects challenges and refines my technical skills, ensuring I stay at the forefront of technology. Amazon's leadership principles aren't just values on paper; they guide every aspect of our work, promoting a culture of excellence and ownership. The fast-paced nature of the company keeps me engaged and motivated, and the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects is both rewarding and intellectually stimulating. Overall, being an SDE at Amazon has provided a platform for impactful contributions, constant learning, and a sense of pride in being part of a tech giant's transformative journey.







Good workplace
Good place to with good work atmosphere decent management good pay best for every level positions good remote work opportunities pathway to upgrade skills

the work culture and everything was kinda bearable but at the end of the day it all comes down to how the management of the organisation is in general; and for the management aspect I'd give it a 3 star."

typical day work
actually to be honest i didn't enjoyed much it was an call centre every day its a typical work to understand customer various problems we need to have patience dealing with those types of situations

Good place to work
Its a good place to work but advancement is slow.
The facilities are good and overall a fun place to woek but management is not that great and you dont have leaders whom you can look upto

Fun at work place
Superb to work with Tesco great culture nice,
The work and management is friendly lovely good.

It's great place to work every little helps servers you better

Great experience
I love to work at Tesco and had good exposure to retail world.
Cultural support with no differences
New learnings technologies guidance and motivation



Good Work Life Balance. Sometimes learning becomes a standstill
Good work life Balance.
Respectful and friendly management
Slow paced work
Lots of initiatives within the company to participate
Only con was that sometimes the learning becomes slow and redundant.

Work Life Balance, Good campus with subsidised lunch. Medium paced work.
Stagnant or redundant learning. Promotions cycles are tedious and slow.
Once a good place to work
I have worked for 8 years in Tesco and first 4 years was so beautiful (good learning, encouraging people around you, recognises and etc . But the second 4 years suddenly they wake up from the dream and changed everything as they wanted and no people management as Tesco once was very good at people. Lots of politics and the seniors won’t respect you nor speak to you. Higher level management has to change. When an employee quits the job is not because of the company it’s because of poor/politics MANAGERS


Downward Spiral
The company has been in a downward spiral post 2019 with increased attrition, wrong hires and work place politics. The company no more seems welcoming to freshness and new thoughts. Colleagues are expected to fall in line or fall out. The HR is a special call out in terms of degeneration. Tons of opportunities to grow but are generally reserved for few. The OJP process is rigged and an eye wash.

Great campus
Stressful, condescending management, ""reservations"", close knitting communities of survivors, lack of visibility, Some Managers and HR exploit personal situations
People friendly and productive place to work
I just loved my experience in TESCO
People friendly
Management is good and supportive
There is no barriers to expose our ideas
Treated equally irrespective of Levels"

Great place to work
Huge workload and long
working hours. sometime lead are also good,
compensation is good but no mental peace. no promotion. lots of perks and benefits, flexibility, people are understanding your concerns that's all.

Overall it is good as per work life balance is considered
The job iw pretty simple. U have certain targets per day which can be completed.work life balance is good and it is completely work from the home. Week offs will be rotational in the weekends only

Good compensation but not good management and no work life balance
Pros:
Good at salary,hikes and bonus
Job security

Cons:
Leadership
No Work life balance
No recognition

Purely depends on project to project basis....


Good company
Good company to work with . Challenging work environment though but you will get to learn if you are keen to learn. Projects given vary from team to team.

Overall ok ok. Hr and finance dept are not upto the mark
Accenture pays better than other it companies, have good policies but Hr and Finance dept are like govt sector. Of no help to employees . Work life balance depends on the project. Job security is there to some extent

Great learning place
Accenture makes sure that it's employees are up to date with the industry standards, technology and skills they person need to have for performing their job well.

Amazing work culture and elite brand name
As a current Project Management Apprentice at Google, I can confidently say that it was an incredible experience that exceeded all of my expectations. From day one, I felt welcomed into the company and was provided with ample resources and support to succeed. The apprenticeship program was well-structured and provided a great balance between hands-on learning and formal training. I was able to work on real projects from the start and was given the opportunity to learn from experienced project managers in the field. Additionally, the training sessions were informative and engaging, providing a solid foundation of knowledge to build upon. One of the things that impressed me the most about the program was the level of support and mentorship I received. I had regular check-ins with my mentor and was given the chance to ask questions and seek guidance whenever I needed it. The entire team was always willing to lend a helping hand, and I felt like I was truly part of a community. Another standout aspect of the program was the emphasis on personal and professional growth. Google provided opportunities for me to attend events, network with other professionals, and even gave me access to courses to improve my skills outside of project management. This level of investment in their apprentices goes to show how much they truly care about the development of their employees. Overall, I highly recommend the Project Management Apprenticeship at Google. It was an incredibly valuable experience that gave me the tools and knowledge needed to succeed in the field. The company culture is exceptional,

Walmart is a multinational retail corporation, one of the world's largest companies. Founded by Sam Walton in 1962, it operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. Walmart is known for its low prices and extensive product offerings.

It's a good working with the great company like Walmart.
and good work culture I learn from my first company in my life.

The hardest part of the job is the sales targets to reach in very less span of time.
but sometimes it's very enjoyable to achieve the targets in time competitive with our colleague.

Affordability: Walmart is known for offering a wide range of products at competitive prices, making it affordable for many customers.
Criticism of Treatment of Employees: There have been claims of inadequate treatment of employees, including issues related to working conditions and benefits."

Good company to work with. Highly professional.
Company is very good. Pay package is okay. However, job is very stressful. Difficult to maintain work life balance. Too much procedures. Minimal man power support. Small little things become big issues here.

Good pay package. company provided car for both official and personal use. Good medical benefits.
Stressful job. No job security. Hard to maintain worklife balance.

Productive but very slow management
Very slow process of engaging young talent into project ad exposing them to the tech and working of a project. Have to wait for a long time just to get moved to a project and sometimes this time goes waste.

Overall Good Experience
Pay can be better for freshers.
Wlb completely depends upon project like any other service based.
Learning curve is good for freshers if mapped to a implementation project.
Internal learning resources are also very good.

gppd
I had the opportunity to gain invaluable hands-on experience and develop a deeper understanding of the industry. Over the course of three months, I was exposed to various aspects of the company's operations, which allowed me to apply and expand upon the knowledge I gained during my academic studies.

One of the highlights of my internship was working closely with a talented team of professionals who were not only supportive but also willing to mentor and guide me throughout the internship. I was actively involved in project work, where I contributed to market research, data analysis, and report generation. This hands-on experience allowed me to enhance my problem-solving skills and learn how to effectively use industry-specific software and tools.

Furthermore, I had the chance to attend meetings and interact with clients, which improved my communication and interpersonal skills. The internship also exposed me to the fast-paced nature of the industry, and I learned how to prioritize tasks, manage time efficiently, and work under pressure.

Great place
Excellent place to work
Competitive environment
Lot to learn im organisation
Flexible time
Good compensation
Hr policy good
Company takes good care of its employees

Good team, bad salary
good team. However, compensation is indeed an essential aspect of any job.
No hike. No work life balance ...
It's disheartening when an employer pays below industry standards or fails to adequately compensate employees for their contributions. Such underpayment can affect employee morale, job satisfaction, and loyalty to the company. When individuals feel undervalued or underpaid, it often leads to frustration and can impact their overall performance and motivation at work. Underpayment can also result in employees seeking better-paying opportunities elsewhere, which may lead to increased turnover and a loss of talent for the company.

Good company to start in IT
- Training is one of the best in Infosys compared to its competitors.

- Salary is elementary for freshers.

- Growth is only good if you work for the long term.

Learning opportunities are good for freshers,not after you have basic knowledge. Pay is less as compared to other companies and yearly increment is next to neglizible.

End you career at IBM
Very good for long term. Work culture is better than any other service based company. Career growth is depend on your project and skills and your network.

Not recommended
Not recommended after seeing the work pressure and aggressive environment. Manager keeps on pushing the team even if delay is from client side. Its ok to be part of support project but do not join any implementation.

nothing is good
no hike nothing worst, nothing much we can do other than to shift organization . so i quit this org. cab facility is good pantry is worst
mine night shift

Depends on project completely and manager
Company culture is good but all of it depends on the project and the management. If your manager is good then everything will work smoothly, otherwise it might get tough.

End you career at IBM
Very good for long term. Work culture is better than any other service based company. Career growth is depend on your project and skills and your network.

Not recommended
Not recommended after seeing the work pressure and aggressive environment. Manager keeps on pushing the team even if delay is from client side. Its ok to be part of support project but do not join any implementation.

nothing is good
no hike nothing worst, nothing much we can do other than to shift organization . so i quit this org. cab facility is good pantry is worst
mine night shift

Depends on project completely and manager
Company culture is good but all of it depends on the project and the management. If your manager is good then everything will work smoothly, otherwise it might get tough.

IBM is good organization no doubt. Unlimited sick leave. Sometime you may feel office politics but overall it's good.

Its very balance lift at conginizant
I left conginzant to pursue information security. I enjoyed being with congizant. We have many opportunities in cognizant both technical as well as infrastrure.

Fun place at Google office
Fun place at Google office with lots of perks and benefits but work pressure is also high and during resigning there is a big problem in FnF. Internal politics is also there.

Wildy depends on your team
Its a service based company, no matter how much you toil - the benefits are limited. Mine was a great team, the lower management was good too, but good dev projects are rare in EPS. Compensation not that great.

Long work hours very less salary
Cognizant's work culture often entails extended hours coupled with inadequately low salaries, presenting a formidable challenge for employees. This combination not only compromises the well-being of the workforce but also raises concerns about equitable compensation. The demand for a more balanced work-life equation becomes apparent as employees grapple with the strain of prolonged hours without proportional financial rewards. Achieving job satisfaction amid these conditions proves elusive, warranting a critical examination of the compensation structure and the overall work environment. Addressing this issue is crucial not just for the welfare of individuals but also for fostering a more sustainable and supportive workplace. As employees contribute significantly to the company's success, ensuring that their dedication is met with fair remuneration is essential for both the morale of the workforce and the long-term success of Cognizant.



Good for Long Term Goals
You will be rewarded with Onsite for your loyalty and will keep getting chances as long as you stay.

They are not paymasters but compensate for this with Onsite roles

Working with cognizant is good and it helped me in growth in carriers.

We feel comfortable working. Good on finding talent

Will get half of the regular pay for overtime.

Great Company
Good place to start your career with. Trains employees well. Day starts with a briefing, followed by daily operations and meal breaks and tea breaks. Learnt daily operations, situation and complaint handling, team management. The management of the company is good and care for the employees. Its a young enthusiastic team of co-workers. Night shifts and long hours are the hardest part of the jobs. Most enjoyable part is the team work and colleagues who work with us.

Typical day starts with a meeting of the challenges. Since it was my first corporate job and that too MNC it helped me a lot in developing self confidence, getting intact with the requirements of the company, becoming a team player and improving my leadership skills. Management is extremely supportive and understanding. Colleagues are friendly and feels like to second home. Hardest part was to meet the targets at times. Enjoyable part were the conversations with friends, lead and managers. Breaks and the fun events at the company.

This was my first company where i learnt me many things in terms of technical and process.
Tech M was my first company where i got trained on SQL and managed to work on projects like AMAT,Chevron and with Microsoft as a vendor.

Good place to work
I have been working with the organisation since 3 years. Work culture is good. Salary could have been better. Stable job and good opportunity to grow if you work sincerely

The organization is really good for Kickstart Career and supportive colleagues.
Starting as a fresher in my first job, the support of my superiors and workshops expanded my career perspective. The toughest moment was resigning for a better opportunity, feeling like leaving a family. The most enjoyable aspect was the absence of pressure in performing daily activities.

Good Company to work
Overall it is a good company to work. You have to have a showman sprit otherwise you will work and other will take the credit of your work. moreover only IT team have off of Saturdays.

Work-life Balance, Learning Opprtunities
It is a good company overall, however
Pros:
1. Good work life balance
2. Multiple domains to learn and grow.
3. Good Training and Learning Materials available.
3. Remote working, no pressure to work from office

Cons:
1. the management doesn't seem to be easily approachable.
2. It takes more than expected time, to get the work done.
3. Compensation Benefits are not up to expectations.
4. Personal growth seems to be slow.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The entire journey at TechMahindra was easy , and dealing/listening + talking to USA customers everyday was stressful because I had to be loud enough so that they could hear me.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Training occupied a lot of time and 1 year spent at TechMahindra was a smooth journey....night shifts WFH environment.

Poor Management and Slow career growth
As an organization,it is a good company to be associated with but from a career's perspective it is not the right company to get along with.

Work-Life-Balance; Education at Work; Trainings
Low Management Standards; Lacking Quality Leadership
Good
Very distressing company where people will judge you and have so many politics in terms of rotational shifts, hence I recommend you to join if you have connections

3 years of experience with Genpact
All About based on your project and manager only. Can't expect Promotions or a good hike. Everywhere systematic approaches and old-school mindset. Average company.

Good organisation
Good organisation in terms of employment. There is a job security, never heard of lay off in company. This organisation has played a impactfull role during Covid. Given job to those employees family members who got expire during Covid

fun and productive, but less salary
If you are a newbie this is the company for you to get to know how BPO industry will work, politics are more, management act as per the business needs, they dont provide any space to grow you besides you will know how to grow from this point because its the lowest at all

nice
nice working environment, work balance and also nice to work. they also give training to freshers before joining the company. so nice experience . .

Job stability and friendly environment
Working here is fun. There is jon stability in Genpact and work culture is also awesome If you want to settle in some company then Genpact can be one of them.

""Genpact's support for work-life balance enhances my well-being.""
A typical day at work in Genpact can be quite productive, but it's marred by a few managers who discriminate against employees. I used to work in the Afghan market, focusing on the Dari language. However, when I transitioned to a process developer role, my contributions as a guide to new employees weren't recognized in my job title. Unfortunately, Genpact retained some individuals who lacked the necessary skills while letting go of more experienced team members. It's regrettable that not complying with a manager's wishes can result in job insecurity.

What I believe I learned is the importance of standing up for fairness and equality in the workplace. Management, although generally supportive, can sometimes overlook critical issues. The workplace culture is diverse, but there are areas where improvements are needed to ensure equal opportunities for all.

The hardest part of the job is dealing with discrimination and the potential for job loss if you don't conform to a manager's directives.

Diverse Work Environment Competitive Compensation
Discrimination Issues in Some Departments Potential Job Insecurity
Hectic and waste

My current team is excellent and having scope of learning.
Overall vertical and business head are good. It also depends on your team. Company police is best,

Best Company compare to others best in salary, work time, Holidays, promotions, paper less work 70% work is easy full digital nice to work here
not flexible in timings, management
Very organized and professional
I am still having contracts to work with Pearson and is a great opportunity to work there.
It's a very organized place and everything goes according to the plan.

Productive and great workplace
PEARSON IS A GREAT COMPANY TO WORK WITH Having good work ethics. Very satisfied with the team and looking forward for lot of challenges ahead with my gean

Nothing to add
Nothing to add at this time. It was an ex-employee so a lot has been forgotten. Hence, at this time nothing to add. It was a great organization, mind the stress on was!

5-star work ambience
stressful; unreasonable expectations; lack of empathy
Productive
It was nice working with the organization. Got to learn many things. Team work was fab. Excellent Guidance. Very Supportive People around. All are brilliant in their work.

Bangalore office is boring and full of dead souls
Working at Pearson is no fun. I would recommend others to stay away from this company. People here are very uninterested in everything. My team was boring and maybe that's why I felt others were boring too

Work isn't very hectic.
No chance of growth in anyway
Worse and Corrupt Management
The management team of India is very corrupt and biased. The job security is next to none. One can be forced to leave suddenly in 5 minutes or be terminated. Sales conveyance expenses are deducted without any reason.

Too many changes in organizational structure
Good place to work with a good culture. Offers enough flexibility in terms of timing. Salary not great but pays decently. A very good learning place with futuristic approaches.

Productive and good environment
good place to learn more. but salary is not enough for fresher.The seniors are very nice and they teach as friendly to freshers and there is good co-operation and good relationship

Not so good experience
It is ok to start as freshers or if anyone is looking for only work apart from salary. Not job gurrantee. Maximum compitition among team. No work plesure.

Exploitative workplace
It was a totally unethical workplace with an indifferent HR department. Weak leadership is supported by unprofessional management . Noone takes employee growth or concerns seriously.

good team work,performance and friendly manner,it is useful for me to grow company growth

cab free
Service based company
Service-based company. Work-life balance depends from team to team and project to project. I wouldn't recommend anyone to join this company. Bench policy is not good in this company.

I wasted my time joining here you don't do the same
What is the best part of working at the company?
The company will not get any feedback from client or they ask for feedback. Nobody knows what you are doing.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
You never know when u will get a hike. Monetarily useless company

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Ok not bad. You never know whats happening in Mphasis as you are at client site or working from home

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Normal. Nothing special or rocket science

Good
Good. No pressure just do the assigned tasks.
Perks depends on projects
Nothing much special but can learn from here as most of the clients are from overseas.

Join if there’s no other option
Mphasis is a service based company they don't care what you know or what your skills are. They simply want to fill the position so that they can earn from the client.
Now it depends on your client manager how your day would be like. My fellow colleagues and I had worked for more than 15 hours for many months initially because of skills mismatch. Nobody cares about it, if client complains, Mphasis management will not back you up. Be careful while giving feedback, always be diplomatic and never point out any negatives.
People like J*y D*bey, Mav**i Chak%, etc. who are from Mphasis managers are very helpful but only on your face.
The only good thing is that they have a lot of study material provided free, however, you will not get time to study.
There is no work-life balance.
There is no post hiring HR help or you will wonder even if any HR exists.
There will be no increments or anything, but there will surely be regular performance evaluation. So always negotiate your salary because they will never give you the correct budget. If they have a budget of 20 LPA they will hire you if you agree for 5 LPA.
You might not get your variable pay most of the times which is a part of your CTC.
Fortunately, I left the company within 6 months, which the first time ever in my career.

Free courses on their employee service website
Unlimited hours of work, no appreciations/awards, no work life balance, no increments, poor management, no HR help after one gets hired.
Good organization but no or poor hikes
Good place to work, people are good.
But there are virtually no hikes. Most profits are paid of as dividend or to buy new companies ( customers).
Variable pay is quarterly about 15 % of your salary.

Good work environment.
Good place to work but lack of growth opportunities and increase in salary. Depending on the manager u might been given all th support you require. Hope this helps."

productive and fun environment
good team work,performance and friendly manner,it is useful for me to grow company growth

cab free
Service based company
Service-based company. Work-life balance depends from team to team and project to project. I wouldn't recommend anyone to join this company. Bench policy is not good in this company.

I wasted my time joining here you don't do the same
What is the best part of working at the company?
The company will not get any feedback from client or they ask for feedback. Nobody knows what you are doing.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
You never know when u will get a hike. Monetarily useless company

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Ok not bad. You never know whats happening in Mphasis as you are at client site or working from home

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Normal. Nothing special or rocket science

Good
Good. No pressure just do the assigned tasks.
Perks depends on projects
Nothing much special but can learn from here as most of the clients are from overseas.

Join if there’s no other option
Mphasis is a service based company they don't care what you know or what your skills are. They simply want to fill the position so that they can earn from the client.
Now it depends on your client manager how your day would be like. My fellow colleagues and I had worked for more than 15 hours for many months initially because of skills mismatch. Nobody cares about it, if client complains, Mphasis management will not back you up. Be careful while giving feedback, always be diplomatic and never point out any negatives.
People like J*y D*bey, Mav**i Chak%, etc. who are from Mphasis managers are very helpful but only on your face.
The only good thing is that they have a lot of study material provided free, however, you will not get time to study.

Good for learning and growith
It is good for freshers as well as for experienced candidates, you will having a lot of new technologies learning there. Colleagues are cooperative, helpful. You get a decent salary.

Highly professional and safety centric organization
Streamlined jobs, learned how to apply systems to get 100 percent results, management gives you free hand to work, completing various mandatory training was difficult and it was camaraderie atmosphere to work for Halliburton

Free coffee
No internal promotion
Productive and Good place to work
The Hub is a great place to work. However there are certain cons that needed to be addressed and sorted. The timings and hybrid work culture is great to experience

Pathetic & regrettable
Too much of higher management reluctant to work but firing the junior level employees who do almost all the work. Managers snatch away or grab the accolades for a good work which actually was done by a junior technical person. Too much micro management & back stabbing, managers don’t keep space for employees to grow. They don’t care for their employees’ mental health as well.

None
Micromanagement, lousy managers, pathetic & biased HR, doesn’t care about mental health
Non productive environment. No conclusive decisions
In most instances all equip was prepared. Mostly incomplete of all needed tools to complete task. I was not allowed in to oversee picking and loading. This is always to way they do their procedures.

No
Can be but this is acceptable.
Nice
Great experience .need more contacts to get a job with great efforts.i wish to tell you that it is almost difficult to get a job with any connections.Also vastha very important

Very fast paced work enviornment
a good place to work in the O&G industry. Indian management is finally in the right hands who can drive the organization in the right direction. The only issue is with the industry which is facing job cuts for the past 5 years.

Great environment
From day one I found it very easy to work in Halliburton, very relaxed management style and I fitted in very easily. Great team ethics and I was welcomed into the team.

Productive, fun place
Healthy work culture. Variety of projects to work on which would sharpen skill-set. Management is friendly, quite open to talk and teams are very co-operative.

A nice place to work at.
Provides a very good work / life balance by planning things well.
This happens because of the strong management in this company.

Being a global company we get to understand the projects dealt with varied kind of customers across the globe.

One of the best company to work for
This company so far has been one of the best companies to work for. The process I was working for company used to provide me travelling allowance if I travel by my own.

relaxed working environment; great teams and team leads
Not so far
Great place to work, Work Life Balance
a typical day at work
- I learned how to defend my self without my supervisor
- Good management but the some issue with the client
- Great workplace and offering WFH
- KPI and also the client
- Most enjoyable part was it's WFH setup


Okayish
It was good, don't expect much in terms of salary and hike. Work culture was okayish. People were nice and decent.
Management could be much better. One way cab facility was a poor thing.


Average experience
Good platform to start your career as fresher. But for experienced candidates its not worth. Long shift hours and Operations managers are not supportive

Fun work place
Concentrix is a good place to work at with a very competitive and positive learning environment. There are regular performance reviews but at the same time managers at senior positions are biased and promotion interviews after a point are mere formality as the managers have already decided who should be promoted

productive and fun to work with
nice work culture and ethics management was more into the employee side ,learned so many things as per industry needs,hardes part was igp as the position were less and candidates which applied to them was more.

allowennce if WFH
sometime long hours
Very productive plus fun to work
What is the best part of working at the company?
Excellent work environment , everyone is approachable , good values ethics and lot of opportunities to work , learnt so much from this company joined as fresher completed 10 years

it was a great job
when i start working with pizzahut it was good time for me i learn everything and i got good feed back doing great job as a i was fresher in resturant field.

My experience with pizza Hut so good
As a riders pizza hut culture is so different
All Manager is good nechoir with me and my team work place culture is a great
Fifo adgest is difficult but not hard
Enjoying make all pizza

Same time after audit manager given me and my pizza hut family party
10, 15, 18 hours
No work life balance
No proper weeks offs are provided no recognition of talent will use us fully and won’t pay as per standards. Very hard to get leaves and lot of politics

No productivity too much pressure
They make us work overtime in less salary and treat team members like labours i mean it's better to work at bus station as labour than to work here! Managers are worst they dont even listen to your opinion also they can take as much as off they want and still they will get paid for that but we as a staff can't take off and if we do our salary will be deducted !! The workplace is very negative and demotivating everyday they make the staff to do overtime and the pay isn't even fair! It's like when there is not sale they decrease the salary but when there is sale they make us overtime like for 15-16 hours and doesn't even pays for that.

Nothing good to learn
Long hours, no respect, worst managers
Fun place to work
Co-Employees were good.
Management is excellent.
I learned to work methodically.
Infact I also learn to do over work if your co-employee is on leave.
And I enjoyed to do work their.

Productive day every day

Best company to work for
I love everything here, the company is following proper Agile, the work-life balance is pretty nice, liked to work here. Free pickup and drop cabs are available. They treat employees nicely

Slow growth
Good support from the seniors, colleagues and management but growth is slow and hikes are also less. Shift timings are not flexible. Mandated night shifts for many departments

Good
Work life balance but sometimes boring depends on teams n managers sometimes monotonous no motivation hybrid model sometimes micromanagement legacy applications

Conservative organization
Moves at a very slow pace,conservative organization. Cares for employees ,but things are changing due to change in higher management's. Unnecessary deployment of tools just because they used it previously without proper testing causing too many issues. It also depends from lob to lob. Few are really good. Overall ok place to work.
