The Best Job Ever
Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.

The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees.

The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job.

Working for a company with a brand such as Apple and experience to match that brand made me want to stay forever.

This is a job I truly miss and I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given!

Productive
It’s been a while since I’ve worked for the company but never the less it was a positive and upbeat environment. There was pressure to meet sale goals and standards so you will definitely appreciate the busyness. Too busy especially the holidays!

Very different retail experience
I worked at the Genius Bar troubleshooting issues with mobile devices for just over a year. I had a lot of different retail and food service experiences but I have to say that working at the Apple Store was a very interesting and unique experience. I learned a TON, not just about iPhones and software but just about customer service in general. I think their training for how to deal with customers is really impressive. I use the techniques I learned there in other jobs and in life in general. I did expect to get more technical training. A lot of the “fixes” for software issues are things you just learn on the job and I felt that the most common issues could have been focused on an practiced in training a lot more than they were. A lot of the people I got hired with are are still there and have moved into other roles or have been promoted. Several have moved to corporate positions. There are definitely opportunities for advancement if you stick with it long enough. Great benefits and decent pay for retail which gets better if you move to corporate level positions. I’d recommend it for people who like Apple and the tech industry. You meet all sorts of people and it will be an interesting experience.

Great employee benefits, impossible mobility
Pay so so. Benefits great. No movement within. Raises are based on annual performance as is schedule bidding. High high standards- they tell you upfront it’s hard to get a “meets expectation” and “exceeds” are rare. If you want opportunities- don’t have a family. Rotations are hard to get and other opportunities require relocation but they won’t accommodate you with kids.

Was great, not anymore
Great for the first 5 years, but afterwards the koolaid gets REAL bitter.

Experience really depends on your management. Management gets paid close to 6 figures for doing nothing.

Co-workers can be cool, but some exhibit some seriously concerning Apple cult behaviors.

Good job for while you’re in college (part time hours fluctuate which can be a good thing or a bad thing) but definitely not a career.

No clear path from retail to corporate either.

Fun
It’s a good pay good environment I recommend it to anyone . Job security is high and good work life balance . People stay for a long time for a reason

Metric driven
Metric driven with no rewards. Constantly being pushed by management to reach targets that are far beyond store average or even possible. Good for short term only

It was disappointing
What is the best part of working at the company?
Many teammates were friendly and helpfu

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Job required was outside of my skill set and domain

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Segmented. There are great teammates but focus is not on team

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Trying to figure out what my duties were

Best place to work
What is the best part of working at the company?
Apple is a great company. I receive a good salary, bonuses, stocks, and a salary increase every year!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I believe it's when we start a new project.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Teamwork, flexible work hours, recognition for hard work, opportunities for growth, inclusivity, and a balance between work and personal life.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
My systems wake up and begin self-checks, ensuring everything is functioning optimally.

excellent
management was nice the hardest part of the job is the customers they are sometimes rude and annoying and the most enjoyable thing is looking at the new devices the store gets

Fun
Good place to work. Very fun. Lots of clients and lots of leads. Smart people all around you in the campus. I am extremely lucky to have worked at this

Metric based, small environment and cool Co-workers
Awful leadership to start off. They do orientation with mental health, passion for customer service and more in mind but don't actually abide by it. They constantly target and attack you to reach these metrics that don't merit any incentive to reach.

You can target metrics consistently and even be a leader in those catergories and the manager will reap the benefits with 5 figure bonuses.

It isn't fair for a 3 trillion dollar company they are truly selfish when compared to the overall compensation of companies.

Best for short term, they work with schedule if you're in school wouldn't go further than that.

Nice place to work
Not a bad place to work. They have good work-life balance and good pay. But not very good for career progression. But overall a good place to work lsl

fun
fun but can be stressful in times of high velocity. good benefits great people. but sometimes slightly too numbers oriented. Apple will try and make you live and breathe apple to work there.


Was a Great place to work... back then.
Apple was a great place to work, now it's but a great place to WOKE.
The entire leftist socialist libturd mentality at Apple. Don't compromise your integrity.

Lots of being yelled at by customers
You’re at call center all day getting yelled at by really impatient unreasonable people but benefits are good pay is ok and no growth really from that point

Woke Agenda
Forced woke meetings every morning in retail environment. Have to walk on eggshells around everyone. Only good benefit was they help pay tuition, and had many benefits for a retail job, especially for a college student.

Great place to work
In my job as a distribution clerk, I managed the flow of goods in a distribution center. My responsibilities included receiving, storing, and dispatching products. I keep track of inventory, ensure proper storage of items, and process orders. I use computer systems to monitor inventory levels and order statuses. Part of my work involves preparing items for shipping, including packing, labeling, and making sure they are sent to the right destination. I really enjoyed my time.

Fell Smitten with the company and the apple lifestyle.
Get in past all the biometric scanning. To then go up stairs and clock in like normal. Do a mental health check in and then daily group debrief called “ daily download”. Open conversation about operations and everyones well being. Proceed to walk to provide an experience to clientele. The most rewarding part is meeting people from all around the world, and having those moments of relation with people who have different perspectives on view of life. Rapport always super amazing. Best job I've ever had. Gives me purpose. They care so much about you so you can care more about the people who make the company flourish. Balanced Ecosystem based on love.

Rapport Building, Employee wellness
bad work
Pros

We work with geniuses - in every department, We create innovative products that thrill our customers and create new product categories - who else can say that?

Cons

ZERO ZERO ZERO work/life balance. Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better. But in actuality, it gets worse every year! It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it, they could fix it tomorrow. They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank. If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance, they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve. Sick of hearing the lies. Just don't lie about wanting to fix it, when they clearly DON'T care

good place to work, good benefits
good place to work, fun and engaging most of the time. Challenging as well, but if you're good with people you will go far. Able to travel and looks good on your resume too.

Joob place to work
Limited work opportunities available you get stuck on testing work unless you are part of the inner circle. Free snacks and drinks. Flexible work hours.

Great avionic company to be a part of
Overall a good place to be if you like avionic or embedded software work in test. Would like to see more variety in projects offered and more training offered to stay relevant as an embedded engineer.

free team lunches, free snacks, company hosted events, can buy out more vacation time
work can be bland sometimes
Great Place to Intern
Great work environment. Flexibility is provided for students when interning. Interns are expected to perform but are also given necessary support to meet those expectations.

Quick pace company needs improvement in work/life balance
Performance software is a young engineering firm mainly with junior to intermediate level engineers. The job nature is to get contracts from different engineering firms and distribute to the in-house engineering teams. The company provided a dynamic expertise and interesting environment since the scope of the job could changed frequently. There is room for improvement in term of work/life balance.

Interesting job nature
Stressful
Great Culture and Hard Work
There are a lot of really hard working and amazing people at this company. It's truly inspiring to be able to work with these people. The culture is amazing, but the work is demanding. I don't think there has been a single project that I have worked that didn't require overtime. There seems to be this weird roller-coaster of highs and lows where you'll being working overtime for weeks to complete a project and then after the project is completed, you are just waiting around doing fluff work until you can be placed on a new project. I feel a wonderful sense of job security because I know I'm supported and I feel the company wants me to succeed. I have had many opportunities with some great people to learn new things and try to grow, but you need to be dedicated to the job if you want to work at performance software.

Amazing people, job security, room to grow
Overtime, Low work between projects, company process changes
Not a good place to work for young engineers
Most of the projects they will put you on are testing projects. They get very little work in the way of software development. The pay and benefits aren't very competitive. The projects are very poorly managed as they typically promote by seniority and based on ones technical ability and not on their actual leadership abilities. I had too many projects where the Project Manager had terrible leadership skills. The projects always seemed to be poorly run and the customer never seemed to be happy with Performance. The companies organizational structure was constantly changing. Seemed like they never knew what they were doing with their hierarchy. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Spend some extra time job searching and go somewhere else.

Stepping Stone
Great place to learn. No advancement opportunities. Management has poor communication with employees. They believe in whatever they want to, without consideration to facts or proof of what actually is going on.

Snacks
Fun workspace with ok management.
For years, Performance had been a fantastic place to work, with great projects and opportunities to advance. Unfortunately, their inability to maintain a company structure that is flexible enough to adapt to the fast changing demands of the industry, resulted in multiple changes within the chain of command. The new management in my opinion has failed to uphold the standard the company was founded on and in return lost focus on what's important. That being said, it is still a great company to be a part of and has some extremely talented engineers.

Fully stocked kitchen and game room
Advancements are slow and bonuses almost non existent.
Productive workplace with a positive culture
I work a lot on documentation, as all Software Engineers do. Sometimes I will get to write code, but the paperwork consists of most of the work. I learn a lot about the software design and testing processes each month. The management is focused and considerate, which creates a positive environment and produces effective results.

Long, boring days in a dull work environment.
Work load / quality depended completely on your assigned project. A majority of your work will be in excel, or excel-type documents. You will very rarely touch any type of codebase. Take this internship only if it is your only option.

Unlimited snacks
Often long days with very boring work
Flexible, fast growing engineering support company
Performance Software is a very skilled group of engineers that are usually assigned to provide technical support to other companies. Performance Software does not build products for sale but help other companies build products for sale. Performance Software has flexible work hours and often sends people to other work-sites to provide the expertise. Some projects are as short as 2 to 3 months and some are a few years. The company is relatively small, i.e. less than 500. As a result, when some contracts are obtained, the company has to ramp up fast and when projects are over Performance has to let people go.

very fun, comfortable and open work area.
Very helpful people. Fun and productive at the same time. Lots to learn
Hours are flexible.
People are helpful and friendly.
Lots of projects and opportunities to learn new things.
CEO is very accessible and friendly.

Greate starting off job
Staff is nice, management is nice, and they keep you in mind. Never had a complain about the management or any employee there.

Free food in the kitchen.
Alittle bit under paid."

Flexible schedule
Each employee has an individual development plan, you can work with your manager to take your career in the direction you want to go. There are many different departments to work in.

Fun workplace
Great place to work, great team mates. New building, good leaders, great growth from within. Great team work, lots of OT if you want it. Good time off

They don't care about employees.
Management is totally clueless and don't care about employees.
Senior management are even worse.
They used to allow remote work but are now forcing people back into the office.


Great experience, great team and management
I enjoy working at Collins. The pay is a low for the cost of living in the area. However there is overtime available. The management is great and the team environment helps give a work life balance.

This is a very rule-bound company.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The pay is very good, and I've had the pleasure of working with some very good people, as well.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Too much work to do and not enough people to do it, especially in my particular department. Management (with which the company seems to be rather ""top-heavy"" is also too numbers-oriented and not in tune with the concerns of the employees on the floor. There also never seems to be any shortage of people who apparently know enough about my job to criticize me when I've made a mistake, but they never know enough to help me with the workload.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
This is a very rule-bound company. I understand the reason for that, which is that the company is a government contractor, and it deals in a federally- and internationally-regulated industry. Security is extremely tight. Additionally, as I note in a previous response, the company also seems very ""top-heavy"" with management, and the managers are very numbers-oriented and not really in tune with the concerns of the employees on the floor.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
The day is long. There's never any real ""down"" or ""slack"" time, because I always have something to do. The pace is very fast.

productive and fun place to work that offers a lot still has challenges.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Culture and open to trying new things.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Poorplanning and frantic last minute deadlines.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Good friendly and positive. Welcoming.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Busy. What's up fast moving pieces not integrated very well with parent company.

Average workplace
Company is fine, pay is average for the industry. Benefits are probably a bit above average. 401k match ends up being like 6%, plus a bonus payment percentage based on your age.

Great place to grow
Being a design engineer at Collins allows you to become a well-rounded engineer because we work with a large variety of materials and processes. Sometimes you can get stuck in a team that isn't working on any new designs and that can get old, but most managers are open to you moving to another team if you feel like you need a change and people are promoted pretty quickly. Diversity and Inclusion initiatives have been on the rise, although overall there is a pretty low level of diversity. The company has been vocal about wanting to improve employee well-being and all levels of management I have worked with have been open to direct feedback. Sometimes our new grads can fall through the cracks a bit on busy teams, but there are great mentors in the department who enjoy teaching. There have certainly been some layoffs in the past few years, but the executives are working on financial strategies that sound sensible to me. Overall very few complaints!

Loved my job
I worked for Collins for a long time. Loved the people. Some of the upper management need better people skills, but I still loved my job and enjoyed working there.

Exciting and challenging projects
Great place to work. Challenging assignments and lots of opportunities for learning and growth. I work with many capable and hard working engineers, which elevates my own skill set.

Well worked, but always had great times each day as we work towards finishing the requjired work.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The ability to teach other employees to enhance their career, great places to work at.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I never had the stress. Folks were very much tuned in with most of everything I had ever dealt with. ENJOYED IT ALL,

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Everyone was a go getter to accomplish the work loads and perfect the actual requirements as well.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
A great day and a day that helps others and training them.

Good stress free
Good place to work and stress free ot when available good pay and good management fellow employees are good i like it better then other companies ive been too

Company is suffering through multiple buyouts
Management is a mess and cannot accurately commit to any schedules due to lack of technical expertise. Most managers lack the skills necessary to reasonably project deadlines or foresee roadblocks. Put simply, there are three managers for every actual engineer. This company is not on the ""up and up.""

I won’t be going back, you either an insider or outsider. Real values are lost.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The type of projects and interesting platforms that they are working on. Good employee base and good location.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Tight, deadlines, inexperienced leaders and it’s stressful deliverables

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Everybody knows everybody it’s a buddy buddy system

Fast paced
Dynamic fast paced environment. , Regular schedule, level loaded production. Open culture with willingness to listen to your ideas about automation and process improvements

No growth opportunities
If you want to stay in the same position for the rest of your career this is for you. Company has good benefits but management lacks leadership in development category.

Kind people lots of change
The culture again how people treat each other and the desire to make great products for customers is the best in the industry. The constant change over the past few years makes it hard to do your job.

Great people that work there
People work well there as a team. The comradery there is great. Executive leadership is consistently changing with in the business unit. This makes for policy and direction to be unstable.

Average
Rockwell Collins was way better. Much more corporatized now, but that can be to the benefit of some. Opportunity to advance if you seek it. Climate control is nice.

Great company
Great management and team work. Lots of opportunities to work cross functionally. Good mentorship and internship programs offered to young employees. Offer great benefits package

Supportive Work Environment
I had the privilege of completing an internship at Collins Aerospace, and I can confidently say that it was a remarkable and transformative experience. From day one, I was welcomed into a dynamic and innovative work environment that encouraged personal and professional growth.

Productive and fun workplace
Great place to start out of school. Excellent learning and growth opportunies. Followership and mentorship are emphasized. Collegial and helpful team members. Exposure to tons of different business models. Brand recognition and good rewards.

Challenging work/life balance, decent Benefits
Great place to start your career in Accounting and a great resume builder. However, the hours are long, not enough pay for the amount of work and effort and dedication to the Company. Benefits are decent.

Good benefits but underpaid
will work you to the core however annual compensation is largely driven by company wider performance, therefore if the Company does not hit targets, regardless of your work performance, you will likely not see large raises unless it is a promotion year.

Nice place to work
People are very nice and willing to help. There is a lot of projects to work on it. People love meetings and coffee chats here. Would reccomend! Not too hard.

High performing workplace
Deloitte has been a good career spot for me to pivot my career path in a slightly different way. Current layoffs cause a feeling of anxiety but there is still growth in sectors outside of tech

Great place to get a breadth of skills
At Deloitte I was able to be a UX/UI Designer, Front End and API Engineer, and Product Manager. I couldn't have had this breadth of experience in industry. Fantastic training, learning and development

Decent company, room for improvement
Deloitte has a lot of smart people and interesting opportunities. However there's also a lot of internal competition and Deloitte doesn't practice some of the values it preaches, leading to a culture where people are polite but not always authentic because everyone is looking out for themselves rather than truly being a team.

Good compensation, learning opportunities, smart people
Lack of real connections, a lot of people stressed out and trying to get ahead
Career opportunities and development
Company with a lot of opportunities and place to develop yourself. There are a lot of learning opportunities in this company.

Salary is upper average but not high.

No work-life balance
Great for career advancement. Good pay. Good benefits. But no work life balance. Lot of long hours. Too much pressure. Pressing deadlines. Makes having family life difficult

Get in with the Cool Kids and all will be well
What is the best part of working at the company?
Benefits were good. Pay was good.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Getting all the right hours in by year’s end. Client hours and firm initiative.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Too much favoritism. I spoke up about an employee who was contemplating harming self due to the work situation. When I described the situation to my manager he called me a liar. As i pleaded with him to take action, the volume of my voice increased . As a result, I was reprimanded for insubordination. My colleague got the help needed despite the inaction of a person in the position of authority.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Very busy and engaging. Work with clients directly, and responsible for others.

Dynamic workplace
Great learning experience and networking opportunities!

It’s a workplace/school in one, except it’s more a practical learning approach. Amazing clients can open up new avenues for you.

In
Pros: Intelligent coworkers, good client portfolio, challenging work

Cons: Overworking certain people and not compensating for it. Hard to jump teams if you don’t have great experience. Won’t let you switch to ARA.

A lot of cost cutting measures - negligible bonus, poor salary increase, lack of work events

Good workplace
Great place to work with room for improvement. Busy season gets pretty overwhelming and depressing and sometimes lasts all year round so keep that in mind

Great name and experience, mixed bag development
You'll work on well-known clients and get great experience that will allow you to get that next best job after a period of time. But your experience will avry based on what clients you are put on and who your manager is. Some of my client teams were great but others there was no direction and you were left to fend for yourself in figuring things out. Probably mentorship would be more focused at a smaller firm but again, your experience will vary based on your manager and clients.

Productive
Challenging work environment with plenty of support from peers and leadership. Great place to gain experience and grow your career. Plenty of opportunities to gain exposure to a variety of projects.

Great Place to Work
Loved my experience at Deloitte. Very generous with time off that could accumulate and be rolled over into the next year. Can be long hours at times but never necessarily felt overworked.

Great learning experience. Poor mental health
Great place to learn. You will learn a lot in a short amount of time. Work life balance is okay if you get a good/nice management but if not your mental health with greatly decline.

Benefits are good but WLB sucks
Depending on your project and how well it is ran, management can pretty much make or break you. The Work Life Balance is more like Live to Work balance. There are so many requirements for you to pass compliance. Benefits are decent

Great culture and technical skills
Enjoyed working for Deloitte and learned a lot while there. Training is exceptional and the Company is truly invested in you being successful. Hours are manageable

good work environment lots of competition
Good place to grow and learn a lot of core consulting skills. Lots of interesting and great work. find your tribe of people and stick with them. creating decks is the name of the game.

Ok
Good experience and got to learn from a lot of very impressive people, including my manager and second coach. However, pipeline was not good and focus on having to do extra-curriculars for a promotion was not enjoyable

Management thinks YELLING IS OKAY!
The management was quite awful. The behavior was terrible. They thought that being aggressive and yelling at employees was okay. It is not. It made the work ambiance toxic and hostile. People couldn't waait to run away and avoid the daily shouting. I left quickly too.

What the management expects are simply unreasonable
The goals set by the management are simply unreasonable. It's like the leadership blatantly creates unattainable targets to pressure and force the employees to work much harder despite the awful compensation and benefits. If the management wants better output, then it should also provide better support, guidance, and compensation. But none of these are present.

Unrealistic Sales Goals, Disrespectful Management, and Broken Promises
From the moment I started working here, it was obvious that the bosses had unrealistic hopes for the sales team. They kept pushing us to make sales, even if we didn't have the tools we neeeded. And when we didn't meet their targets, they scolded us and made us feel worthless. Another irritating thing about the job was bad the communincation from the bosses was. They often gave us confusing or conflicting instruction, making it hard to do our jobs right. When we asked for help, they talked down to us and brushed us off. On top of that, the bosses never kept their promises, so we were always rushing to meet our goals at the last minute. All of this stress and uncertainty made it really hard to stay motivated and get work done. Overall, the mix of unrealistic goals, disrespectful bosses, and unreliable support made the workplace really unhealthy and impossible to do well in.

Selfish Management Makes Terrible Decisions
The top management was extremely selfish. They made some poor decisions and hired people on a whim. Then, they let go of those people without thinking about how they would manage without a job and a paycheck. Their arrogant and awful attitude led to many people fearing job loss and being under constant stress due to it. As I was one of them, I left before things became mere complicated.

It's a small company so you know everybody.
Unsupportive Management and Soul-Crushing Workload
Let me tell you, the CEO there was an absolute disaster. First of all, I never got the proper suport or guidance from my manager, so I was left hanging, not knowing what the h*ck I was supposed to do. The whole setup wa biased in favor of the higher-ups, and they treated us, the little guys, like we were disposable. And let's not even talk about the pay-it wa insulting! I felt severly underpaid for the mind-numbing and soul-crushing work they expected me to day in and day out. The workload was just impossible to handle, and with the CEO's lack of direction, it was like walking through a maze blindfolded.

Responsibilities were brutal and more exhausting than I'd ever imagine!
The amount of multitasking was crazy insane and the responsibilities were brutal, stressful, and more exhausting than I'd ever imagine!

Company's Inconsiderate Approach Towards Addressing Concerns Lead to Dissatisfied Clients
Although the technical team exhibited commendable expertise, the lack of effective communication channels with supervisors stalled progress. Additionally, an obstinate resistance to adapt to evolving industry trends resulted in a thrashing of potential opportunities for growth and innovation. The company's inconsiderate approach towards addressing customer concerns further compounded the situation, leading to dissatisfied clients.

Ruining my life
Entire team surpassed sales goals last year and we all received a 50% pay cut, along with more workload. I have never in my life seen a company screw their employees this bad.

CEO's Close-Mindedness: A Hindrance to Innovation and Growth
My optimism quickly turned to disappointment as I encountered the CEO's close-mindedness, which transformed it into the worst professional experience of my career. His behavior was reminiscent of a blockhead, lacking any semblance of open-mindedness or willingness to consider alternative perspective, making it difficult for employees to propose new ideas or challenge existing processes. Instead of fostering an environment of collaboration and growth, the CEO's narrow-minded approach created a toxic atmosphere that hindered both personal and professional development.

What a terrible and inhumane work place!
The culture and overall environment is built around instilling fear. Micromanagement is at its highest level. Upper management wants to control every little thing. You can even overachieve in targets, they will always find something negative to focus on. Moreover, they underpay people and when they needed a pay rise mist, they turned their back. This was the worst mistake I ever made, I had so many offers and took this job over other simply because of the lies I was being told.

I've learned what NOT to look for in an employer, literally the only good thing to come out of working there.
Frustrating, demoralizing and dumb place to work
iBoss will sell you hopes and dreams but never deliver on any of them. If you started working there recently, be warned, get out while you still can. Management seems to think that employees are interchangeable, so they will lay off a bunch of people without any explanation. Also, they love to micromanage rather than trust the subject matter experts. It's frustrating, demoralizing, and dumb. AVOID THIS PLACE. You'll get depressed here.

I can't think of a single positive thing about working here. You might find some cool people to hang out with.

Leadership in upper management exhibits a lack of TRUST and ABUSE.
Micromanagement causes a lot more stress than being left alone and working independently. Upper management's leadership shows NO TRUST, thinking employees would fail or lie about their work. Makes them control freaks, ABUSIVE of their authority, and still resort to blaming which is AWFUL!

Extremely toxic micromanagement
The toxic management really annoys the employees in this place. We all suffer under the same set of toxic managers, and that's something that we actually bond about. The managers are extreme micromanagers who will never stop breathing over your shoulders whenever you are doing something at work.

The Leadership Was Really and Insulting!
THE LEADERSHIP WAS TRULY TERRIBLE HERE. The people in the upper management had a group of sorts, and THEY LIKED CRITICIZING EMPLOYEES AND MOCKING THEM. It was horrible because they insulted you in front of the whole office and never appreciated you. It made the entire WORKPLACE TOXIC.

Also, THE TOP MANAGEMENT BLATANTLY LIES ABOUT TRAINING AND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES when there are none. It led to high employee turnover. BEWARE!

They don't deserve to be leaders
We work up to complete exhaustion on a daily basis, and I've reached a point where I couldn't even drag myself to work, The managers and supervisors who are supposed to support us, don't show up when we needed their help. We have no idea what they do, but they don't deserve to be leaders.


Pros:
Whether you're newly hired, all employees are eligible to receive incentives and benefits.

No reason to be here
There's no reason to be in this terrible place. Working here means sacrificing your work-life balance while also not having any stability in your job. The salary is also awfully low compared to the company's competitors, not to mention the lack of salary raises and opportunities for advancement. There are plenty of other companies that have a better work environment and culture and higher salary than this one, so there's reason for anyone to stay here.

Stressful Ticket Load
The ticket load was very high, so I was dealing with stress most of the time. The upper management was no hiring enough tech support people to be able to solve all the tickets swiftly. It was horrible. Avoid if possible.

Good while it's good
Where do i begin? First of all, the management in the office I worked in was a bunch of folks with over inflated egos of themselves who treated their subordinates in a terrible manner. The company chews up young employees. if you didn't fit the culture, then they found ways to harass you until you quit. There were really good engineers who were mistreated until they quit.

All about achieving goals and targets
We are asked to work even on weekends and not take a break if we have to. Everything here is about achieving goals and hitting targets and they don't care about employee welfare and wellbeing.

Great on the outside. Terrible on the inside
The level of skill and leadership through the entire Engineering department leaves a lot to be desired. Expect to put in 10+ hour days, you will work weekends often. With offices all over the world you are expected to work all hours to accommodate different time zones. When you ask for deadlines, everything needs to be done ""yesterday"". My advice, take the job if it is last resort.

A joke of a workplace.
Management uses intimidation to apply pressure on employees. Healthy feedback on business decisions is seen as threatening and seen to be grounds for termination for a number of employees. If you started working here recently, be warned, get out while you still can.

None whatsoever, I would not recommend this place to start your career at all."

Great place to work
Very technical and interesting job. The teams within my department were bright and a pleasure to work with, for the most part. I would recommend this job for fresh college graduates looking to gain good engineering work experience in the semiconductor industry.

Aging tech company attempting reform
I worked at Intel for over 20 years. The company is so large that there are opportunities for one to change roles and grow; however, it can be challenging to move into a totally different area. Intel is one of the oldest tech companies today. It has a strong corporate culture and is in the process of attempting to evolve into a different type of company. One that manufactures for others and not just itself. Just like any other large organization, it can be quite nepotistic, but that's to be expected. Overall, it is a huge, multi-national corporation that has all the benefits and drawbacks that comes with that.

Great pay and benefits with bad culture
I'm a fab engineer. It's a high pressure environment with an unsupportive work culture, but it pays well and work life balance has improved in recent years

Lost their way
Intel are used to be a higher flyer valued creativity from its employees. It is now a top down organization that does not appreciate feedback. With their business decisions, layoffs are always possible.

Great place to work overall.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Great benefits. Very smart people. The company is going through a down cycle but will make it back.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Every year for 12 years I was not sure if I would still have a job due to constant reorgs.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Hard work but family is always considered a top priority.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Meetings, meetings, meetings. All remote.

Near constant uncertainty
Company tends to reorganize and change directions too often
Too many failed attempts to grow business have resulted in losses and job losses
Much of your experience, good or bad depends on your manager

Great Environment
Great development environment. The career paths are plentiful and the ability to develop a network provides room growth. Leadership can be turbulent at times.

Decent pay, Archaic management and decision making
The pay is decent but far from competitive however the decisions made where purely based on quantity out and not quality. Management ignored complaints about literally broken system. That is not metaphorical the systems we used literally did not work and we were told to just deal with it. In the current market I would not advise Intel as a welcoming environment to work in.

Good place to work
Nice work-life balance. Decent amount of pay, allow you to work from home. The managers are quite cooperative and keen to learn in most of the groups.

Wouldn’t recommend
Management is terrible; most of them are Boomers, so you can get a fair idea of what type of people you will be working with.

Also, inclusion is a big deal here, so no matter how qualified you are, if you are not a minority, good luck.

Don’t get me wrong, you may be really, really lucky and land in one of those positions where everything is perfect, but it is unlikely. Unless you know someone, you will not be landing in these positions. The company is truly about who you know.

If, however, you decide to go for it after reading this review, make sure you negotiate your salary. Don’t fall for the “bonuses” or the “incentives” that they promise, as this can be taken away at any point (which happened this year). So make sure you get what you are worth.

Incredibly fun, challenging work and high expectations that make you proud!
What is the best part of working at the company?
Flexible working environment, challenging work, ridiculously smart people, learning every day, great benefits, growth and mobility, investment in learning

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Expectations are high here. You have to be ready to put your whole self into your work everyday, but it pays off!

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
People work hard and play hard. We have a lot of fun, have community events and local employee activities, but we also work incredibly hard. The hours are reasonable, but the expectations are high.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
I work from home most days. I start around 8, spend most of my day in meetings and almost never catch up, but I love my colleagues and believe we are changing the world, so it's all good.

Good place to work
I love the people that I work with The higher ups actually listen Room for growth They encourage me to be my best Everyone is so supportive The company gives back to the community

very average boring work place
Intel is not for someone who wants to think out of the box and has ambition to grow.
Pay is okay, Management is fine if you don't want promotion or pay raise.

Coworkers were great
I like the intent that the managers had. They tried to ensure everyone received what they needed. Coworkers were great to he around and the work was easy.
Benefits were fantastic but the pay was on the low end.

Production is top priority; training only happens rarely, yet you are expected to know
a typical day starts at 0740 am or 1940 pm with pass down meeting of what happened on the previous shift and what needs to be done. The senior employees pick and choose what they are doing and the rest of the duties are handed out to junior employees. As a technician, you will ask and ask for training from senior personnel and they will do it if they like you, when they are in a good mood. If you are an engineer, then you will receive links to learn your module and an advisor that wants you to figure it out and will give you HINTS on how to solve your issues. You will attend many Teams meetings and after 3 months you will be required to understand the specifics and how to resolve them. As a junior engineer after certification, you will go on an on call rotation which is 24 hours a day for 7 consecutive days. Essentially you will sit in front of a couple screens all day and watch the production events and also be given action required (ARs) projects. Timing is everything and you need to immediately engage with the floor if there is a production abort or tool problem. When you are new or an engineer for the first five years, you will be required to go on call every other week. You will not have time to go out and you will sleep with your work phone by your bed. There will be a morning meeting at 0740, so you will need to always be online by at least 0600 am and look at production details that recently occurred, problems, consumable changes, overall preventive maintenance schedules for all your tools. I was in CMP so we had approximately 100 tools for the techs

gym on campus
too many to list
Fun workplace
Great place to work learned a lot met interesting people, good management decent pay decent health benefits onsite gym and doctor good work life balance

Fun technology
State of the art tech. Pays well, good management, great benefits. Always some new project in the works. Company has a good world wide reputation and makes good products

Great Place To Work
What is the best part of working at the company?
Intel was booming! It truly was a Great Place to Work. Treated us with respect and allowed us to do our jobs without getting in our way - they empowered us

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
at the end, there were layoffs every six months

Excellent
""Thriving in Intel's dynamic labor role! Diverse tasks keep it engaging. Supportive team, cutting-edge environment. A rewarding journey in innovation!""

Great Company
Good company too much work.
First day at work there was an orientation and they teach you everything you need to know but right after you get lots of tasks

Culture
The work day can be very gruling, but err go the nature of the business. You get back what you put into it. Intel has a Culture of Caring, which means they truly care about their employees and their contractors. I was a Construction EHS Engineer for 3 years, and 2 years prior to that, an EHS Engineer contractor.

Work/Home life can be very challenging. It can be easy to get caught up in your work so much that your home life can have an impact. But it is critical for you to recognize this and speak with your manager, as that balance needs to be in place. Intel Management (the good ones at least) will ensure you maintain that balance.

Infosys,"





Productive
Great learning for freshers, great growth opportunities, focused on reskilling aspects, lots of project opportunities in various domains, overall great company to work

Comfortable And Limited Growth
Worked in Infosys in 4-5 projects during my tenure. Had good experience in 2 of them and not so good in the rest. The folks are not the brightest to work with. That's the biggest challenge. There's basic miscommunication and no basic work etiquettes. Work could be better if the team and processes improve.

Broad Experience
Plenty of exposure and work to be done. Lots of different technologies. Opportunity to learn and switch if you dont like what you are doing. Long hours, weekend work.

Good opportunity to learn new skills
good opportunities to learn new skills But HR or company has poor communication / processing capabilities. You can experience multiple projects as possible

Great
Good Experience, Got to learn and explore different things. The good team environment and campus are so great which motivates us to be around and work harder.

Good infrastructure
Lot of politics but great office space. Have to dolot of hard work to get recognized in the team.
There's lot of internal politics and you won't be given hike or good rating easily.

A lot of work and little pay
Bad parking bathroom smells bad over all not to bad but just not for me I didn't like the management or the team leads and it's super cold in the office and a lot of work with little pay

Short break bad parking ac super cold bathroom smell bad
Room to skill up.
Some managers are very supportive but not all. Sometimes not good recourses relevant to what you need to do the job. Overall I liked been there. Wished to work there for more years but I understand why they fired me with many other people that were there for a year without been utilized.

More independent
No job security
Good company to start
InfosysLimited is a very good company to start your career journey, specially for fresher. You will benefit from a great training on demanding technology. They offer free voucher for taking any cloud provider certifications

good
good place to start career. there are different tracks that you can work on to develop various skills. not too much downtime as there are many projects available to be on

Great company to work with
Infosys is my first employer. I joined Infy soon after my Bachelors in Engineering. I would recommend Infy to freshers as their six months training is a great asset for any IT professional.

You live you learn and look for better opportunities.
What is the best part of working at the company?
There were no great experiences. Worst company ever!! At this very moment they’ve been ransome!!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
They don’t care about their employees and there was always system issues.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Stressful and overwhelming. The training was not helpful.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
System issues and on the phones with exhausting customers

Horrible Company if you are an American
This is a horrible company. They do not care about the employees. India based and everything revolves around that. Horrible benefits, no raises. Don’t let the companies response that they offer compensation believable, well they DO NOT! Nothing, nada. They have management that does not stand up to employees and lets the employees do whatever that want. Puts the work on certain employees while others do nothing. Run far far away from this place.

None
Horrible work environment
No remote work
Good companytypical day at work,
what you believe you learned,
management,
workplace culture,
the hardest part of the job,
the most enjoyable part of the job

Decent first job
Not bad for a first job out of college. Training in various subject matter was provided, with a focus on knowledgeability and employability so you could be contracted out to another company/project. A lot of the time was spent keeping up to date on training while waiting for that project to come along.

Ok job
Infosys L T D is an okay workplace. The software training doesn't align well, and once assigned a project, you're mostly on your own. Good for self-starters.

Language Barriers and Poor training options for employees
What is the best part of working at the company?
Work From Home that is it. I don't have much else to say.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The language barrier, the attitude from HR and leadership. Just to speak on leadership, after the training you're on your own. When it comes to learning new software, you are completely on your own, it's a self-taught setting. Once you get out of training, there aren't any other helpful resources to use to grasp an understanding of a software that your manager wants you to learn after training. Managers don't help you learn it either. Infosys should have live trainings for software that they want their business analyst to learn after training.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Unpredictable some good days, some days managers and hr are mad because you cant understand them and ask them to repeat themselves. LANGUAGE BARRIER

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Youll be doing trainings or interviewing with clients if you're not on a project.

Terrible
What is the best part of working at the company?
Ability to work from home and decent hours of working from Home.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Having to go the management for everything. No ability to make decisions. No diverse leadership no women in leadership.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Unpleasant disorganized environment.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Stressful environment too much work and not enough people to work on things. Every task takes so long to complete or be approved.

Fun workspace
Good company to work and lot of onsite opportunity’s to grow. Lots of onsite opportunities as well.

Very hard to get promotions and hard to get visibility

Analyst
Its a good company to work in. I highly recommend it. The learning experience is great and the culture is good. Growth opportunities are less but it is good to learn.

Good work Life Balance
Good work life balance but limited learning opportunities. Lack of new technology stack and mostly the projects are on support side. Pay range is very less as compared to the market

JPMorgan-Chase-&-Co-7555c073,"





Fast paced yet fun
This job will be a bit much for the introvert, but the pay is great, even during inflation they would essentially match your pay to combat expenses!

Embarrassing place
Unprofessional management who consistently told their personal business at work and would argue with each other. Horrible training. Miserable employees.

Merchant Services
Could be great, just depends on territory and your manager. Same goals whether you have a major metroplex or smaller towns, and the senor staff have the better areas.

Great place
Have enjoy my time working at JPMC. Nothing negative to say and always on top of everything. Such a big company that does its best to make everyone feel included and welcomed.

Fair place to work
The work was hard, but the pay was fair and matched our effort. The bonus structure needed work as did the year end review. The co workers were fun and cam from all different backgrounds. Great team atmosphere. There were so many people that you couldn’t see any upward mobility.

Better than other banks
Pays better than others but boring and repetitive. Typical corporate work culture but your coworkers matter. Had to deal with a lot of creepy old men

Toxic
There is no career advancement. Constantly having to “manage up” branch managers who are never present and exploit you because you do a great job. The hardest part is working for a company that does not care about you.

Great work culture - need governance improvement
Great work culture - need rigor to improve governance around product delivery.

Need to focus on qualitative improvements alongside quantitative improvements.

Great job & benefits
The benefits are unmatched and a great work environment. I really enjoy the upbeat attitude and positive training. Lots of room for advancement and moving ahead with this company

Great Company
JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for. I recommend to any business major. You will learn a lot, meet great people, a lot of opportunity, and they pay very well.

Good paying
Good paying. It’s been awhile but friends still there say it’s the same and you know what to expect. It’s a good resume builder as well since you get a ton of experience.

Productive and great place
Great place and plenty of room to grow. My lead supervisor was friendly and lenient, but in order to get more hours you have to prove yourself and to them that you’re willing to get there.

It was great until it wasn’t.
Managers can be a bit pushy about adding new services and accounts even when it’s not the best fit for customers. I would frequently be asked to charge 80 and 90 year old clients $6 for monthly statements because they were unfamiliar with, unwilling, or unable to access the information online. my coworkers were great though.

It was alright I guess
Pretty standard back office finance job. Not too great not too terrible. Pay was average. It’s an alright starting point but I wouldn’t stay in the role too long

Good environment and benefits
They are very flexible, good management. They every months they do different events, great opportunities to network. They have something call Learning catalog where you can learn about whatever they want

Good Position, Make sure you work well with your manager
You get to help lead a branch. You will be the go to person if the branch manager is unavailable. The benefits are pretty good but pay is lower but they have been improving.

Good pay and benefits, job can be stressful
I worked here for 5 years and the pay and PTO was decent. Management monitors your performance to make sure you meet your metrics. Back to back phone calls at busy times and rude customers can make it stressful at times.

Supportive yet demanding
Over 15 years, have largely found very supportive leaders who show investment in your success, but requires consistent personal commitment on the employee as many managers have challenges of their own. High emphasis on self discipline to keep yourself on your career track but the opportunities for new roles, promotions and managing projects of interest at work are vast. Took one star away for discrepancies in office experience.

It can be a fun experience, you can dress casually, but it’s typical corporate culture.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Teamwork and the culture within the team you work on.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
You’re essentially a number. Scheduling pto is a bit tough. You have to use sick time if there is no availability to schedule a segment off. Mental health is spoken of but not a priority. There is free therapy but if you’re genuinely broken your option is to use pto. If you have none you can take a leave but it’s unpaid.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Individual team culture can be amazing. Employee appreciation events, etc is often just free junk food and colorful decorations.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Work 2 hrs, 15 min break. Work 2 hours, lunch. Work 2 hours, 15 min break. Work 2 hours, go home.

Professional team and high level technology stock
It is all depends on the team and managers. It’s a big company, so working for one team and be happy within it might not be true for another. I was lucky to be part of Professional team, good managers

Ftt
I don’t really know what to say about this job considering that I only been here for five months and it’s horrible but it is typically a good workday

Raytheon,"





Productive workplace
The team dynamic was great and there was ample support for when I needed it. Working remotely came with its own challenges though and I wish there would have been an option for some days in person.

they do not care about you at all
If you have work/life issues do not expect Raytheon to help you. When my family member became severely ill, instead of helping me, my shift was changed making it impossible to maintain care giving responsibilities. Management will not back you up if anything happens and are only concerned with ""CYA"". They will throw you under the bus at the first possible chance to deflect any responsibility they had. They are more concerned with their retirement date than managing.

it's just another ""job""
Management is not there to help you, Horrible work/life balance, Callousness and make you feel like you are replaceable

1
Very eh
It’s aged and really hasn’t gotten with the times. One would hope that they would realize they need to invest in their employees. I can only hope that they will figure it out soon.

Poor for Growth and Egotistical Pipeline
The company is solid, people are nice for the most part and the atmosphere is good. However, a very large chunk of software is outsourced, therefore full time SWEs and interns don't get to actually write any code. Some managers and employees think very highly of themselves for being in any slight way managerial or subject expert. Peoples' egos get to their heads.

Total rewards good, work balance uneven
Pro's: Compensation inline with industry. Easy to learn from other engineers.

Con's: Work life balance can be poor especially for high performers. High turnover also leads to uneven workloads.

Good first job to work
Good benefits with good salary and relocation. I came here as a fresh grad out of college from the university of Massachusetts lowell. The clearence takes a long time but besides that it’s good.

Great Place to Work
I enjoyed working for Raytheon. They pay well and they are very understanding of employee's personal lives. They are very flexible if you need to take the morning/afternoon to take care of personal business. Management seems to really care about employees not just the bottom line.

Decent Place to Work if You Want to Settle
decent place to work. work loads changes by the season. can be really slow one month then crazy the next. promo's aren't great unless you say you're looking elsewhere.

Good people
Great company to work for. People are friendly.
Great company to work for. People are friendly.
Lot of hours and work life balance is there. The pay is very competitive. Good place to work if your end goal is to graduate from school.


Draining, disappointing, don't get comfortable there or you may die an early death, or be let go for trying to improve things.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Benefits are good, salary is good.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Company attends to problems with short sighted solutions, very disorganized. You get different answers depending upon who you ask. Expectations can sometimes be unreasonable.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
One of those companies that tout Dei to the point where it feels condescending to diverse employees. Proof is not yet in the pudding or they wouldn't need to shout about it.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
The same thing day in and day out. Not a company that is up to speed on best practices which is a little frightening considering their products.

Fun place to work at, people are extremely nice.
Raytheon Technologies was definitely a fun and easy going place to work at. Everyday there was something new to work on and people were generally happy. Willing to teach, etc. Only issue I had was switching shifts, despite this it's still a fun place to work at and I recommend for machinists.

Nice community, easy-going
Harder to switch shifts/to part time
Fine
Not all terrible but some days were my boss was trash, the jobs was cool. Got laid off and didn’t get severance after 10 years. I wouldn’t recommend working there honestly.

Good work place
I enjoyed my time at Raytheon. I enjoyed having every other Friday off and everyone was nice. Very nice company to work at as an intern. I would recommend them to anyone.

Fun place to work
Excellent management. Great people to work with. Good pay and enough time to recharge after hard work. Very professional. I enjoyed working with Raytheon.

Good environment, lots to learn
You are entirely in control of your trajectory. Self starter/initiative will take you as far as you want as long as you’re good at politics. Culture can be hit or miss but know your audience and you’ll be fine.

Bad
No advancement opportunities, union so everyone gets payed the same no matter how hard u work or dont work , no communication, last second mandatory overtime,

Well known, great benefits
Management of 38 Custodians , throughout a Military Missile plant. Very professional Culture where continued to learn something new every day. The most challenging part of the job was to manage 38 different personalities. The most awarding part of the job was completing challenging projects.

New exposure to challenges.
Working 2nd Shift
Great benefits, and 9/80 schedule
Good place for growth. You get every other Friday off which is nice. Benefits are amazing and leadership is competent. Lot of opportunities for growth.

Positive
""I had a wonderful experience working at Raytheon. The company places a strong emphasis on innovation, teamwork, and professional growth. The projects I worked on were challenging and impactful, and I had the opportunity to collaborate with incredibly talented colleagues. The company's commitment to ethical practices and corporate responsibility was evident in the way they conducted business. Additionally, the benefits and work-life balance provided were excellent, contributing to a positive and supportive work environment. Overall, my time at Raytheon was both rewarding and fulfilling.

9/80 is nice
I like the 3 day weekends every other week. Co workers were pretty stuck up and it has that corporate culture that sucks the life out of you. Thats it

Good pay, work tasks okay.
Okay to work. 9/80 is good. You see everything, good people and toxic people as well. Mostly good Id say. Big issue is the outdated technology and very little chance to work on new technology. Dealing more with processes. You can get support to advance your degree to a certain extend.

Supervision was exceptional
My job was a Military Family Life Counselor. My supervisor possessed a generous amount of experience doing the job I did in the past. She understood and the nuances of the and was able to verbally guide me through challenges. The daily situation at work as very satisfying and rewarding, working with military members and families. MFLCs also work closely with military unit command staff members and conduct briefing for varying situations.

Perfectly fine
I am writing this review so I can open the reviews for a company I am possibly joining. Leidos was fine, pretty standard contracting company. Good pay, benefits and room for advancement

Positive and Challenging Environment
-Every day poses new challenges keeping you engaged and further developing your professional knowledge.
-Wonderful Leadership throughout the company.
-Friendly work environment.



Solid for career
Coworkers are great, and the projects are interesting. The benefits are pretty good as well with a 401k. Can be some red tape but pretty much unavoidable for defense.

You will get by
The most enjoyable part is getting to leave. I have definitely learned a lot at the job although the leads and management do not always show interest in helping the employees or provide enough guidance

Leidos committed to Excellence
Leidos is a Top Tier company.
Superior Ethos and commitment
To excellence, fairness, Teamwork,
And Diversity!

I would be honored to work with Leidos
Again as well as recommend them to
Qualified candidates.

Too many to mention!
None known.
Productive and Fun Workplace
Great place to work. Not challenging at times. Colleagues are sometimes just biding time. Opportunities if you look for them. Experience depends on your manager.

Great company
Leidos is a great company to work for. While I do miss the benefits and the mobility, there were certain things about the site that I worked at that I wanted to get away from.

good place to work
The most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork. Workplace culture was acceptable. Salary was good. Reviews needed improvement. Acknowledgement needed improvement.

Frequent touchpoint
Unclear communication with management
Solid career with Government client
The job duties largely depend on your particular client. Work culture is very flexible and compensation has been more competitive than in the construction industry. Team is spread out, which makes communication a priority.

I would recommend working here.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Either you're accepted by others or your out. Lots of favorites and you'll know who they are.


What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The lack of training on things that you need to know. They expect you to know everything they expect, but never tell you in advance.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Laid back, until crisis hits the fan at the last minute.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Working, casual break times. Looking forward to the end if the day.

Toxic
If you are wondering what it will feel like to work here, look up Toxic Work Environment online. It is a spot-on description and better than writing paragraphs here.

Working with the military, flexible work schedule
Everything else
Repetitive and unorganized
Upper management takes on all sort of work knowing there's not enough manpower to complete them. Then pushes a boatload of work on you, with a tight tight deadline.

Great team, geared for growth
The team I work with are fantastic and supportive. Leidos as a whole has a good outlook on allowing their employees to spread their wings, and they like to see you take advantage of that. It's encouraged. Definitely recommend.

Flexible hours, great people all around
Typical day at work:
40-hour week. Core hours 9-3.
You're at your computer all day, but you're free to get up and walk around as you please. Half design, half paperwork. Going out into the field is also pretty nice.

Management:
They're good people to work for. Usually good for a word if you need one.

Culture:
Open office plan, so consulting with colleagues is easy. Everyone is very supportive of each other.

Hardest part:
Some tools and processes can be slow with few workarounds. It can make the work tedious at times.

Best part: The people, the hours, the office culture.

Good people not competitive
Good people and decent management. The people above you care a lot, though direction from corporate doesn't reflect the same. Plus the pay is low vs competitors

Nice company
Nice team members, but pay is not very good especially when you stay there for many years, increase at 2-3% each year. Always busy with a lot of meetings.

great place
remember its all contract work, so when the end of the contract is close, be on the look out for new opportunities within and outside the company. They help, but really it isn't enough.

Easy notes. Good pay. Stupid rules—like doing “counseling” with one hand tied behind my back.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Occasional raises (unrequested)
Easy notes
Independence

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Stupid rules
Management not supportive or appropriately trained
Company is taking away perks that incentivized my desire to work there.
Not treated as a professional
Lack of needed ability to print
Technology issues and lack of appropriate devices.
Outdated password management & 16-word passwords.
Isolation and lack of professional support
The list goes on & on
They are supposed to be an ethical company but they have “thrown me under the bus” on numerous occasions.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Ok. They are trying. They had no clue how to take on a contract like this but they are fine-tuning things.
I see that they did not hire many experienced people in the transition and they are going to lose far more people in the very-near future.
They have Virgin Pulse and other mental health options but the management could care less about me as a person, my professional development and my future with the company.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Drive to location. Deal with emails, technology. Feel schizophrenic with two people overseeing my work who have completely differing goals and expectations. See clients. Write easy notes. Do outreach by walking around. Non-medical counseling.
The company makes bundles of money off from us but we are not a priority. They could pay us double but, instead, they are taking away perks.

Sub-Par MFLC Pay
Leidos underpays MFLCs compared to other counselors/therapists with similar training in the region. Lots of MFLC’s are leaving.

The company boasts about all their profits and how much $$ they make, Leidos is TONE-DEAF. They did not give us raises when we asked .

The job is great as a school-based counselor, you help so many people. Leidos pretty much does ZERO to help you “get started” at a new school. You have to “beg” for an office at the school. It is pathetic. Some schools won’t give you an office at all. It’s disrespectful and sends the message “Leidos won’t speak up for you as an employee.” You basically fend for yourself. Good luck begging to use a copy machine and a stapler. Basically you have to find teachers/school staff that “feel sorry for you” to gather you some supplies.

They don’t give adequate PTO/Sick days. They make you work on VETERAN’s DAY while you school is NOT in session. How us that “respecting” veterans? They will tell you you will make $xx,xxx, but it will be MUCH LESS. You will get no pay in Summer or during long school breaks. Their “cute”

Positive: Many of the fellow MFLCs (who you might only see once a month), are caring people & counselors. There are some good team leads. If you have a bad team lead, your life will be difficult.

Nice place to work. On the job training is phenomenal
I learned a great deal . I had never taken zoom classes but everyone at Wells Fargo main branch helped me and made my training a very good experience. I later enrolled in online classes atWGU due to the experience and confidence that my coworkers had given me.

On the job training
Short staffed

Okay
Very good pay, not much work, no room for growth and not treated great. Good work life balance but not much of a future. Cafeteria is really nice as are amenities

Great Place To Work But Consistently wants upselling
Worked with Wells Fargo for 10 plus years. very good company and tries there best to promote within. I can remember being pregnant with my 3rd son and received 4 months off fully paid.

promotion within, yearly raises, fair pay and benefits
jealous management

Productive and fun work place
Fast paced environment may receive up to 200 calls a day. Can be frustrating but also fun depending on perspective. Always an opportunity for advancement, the culture there is fun, encouraging basically you get what you put forth.

Work from home, benefits, pay
Back to back calls
Learning and can move up quick
Good benefits, get to learn alot about business through helping business owners with their finances, lending, payroll, merchant etc... can move up if you're always above average.

Great benefits - Limited Promotions
Great place to work however promotions are limited. Lately when someone has left a higher position their job simply gets closed or moved out of state.

Good pay and benefits
Would have worked here till i retired. The loyalty that i had for this company was unmatched until i was laid off with no warning or help to keep job after 7 years with the company.

It was fantastic!
What is the best part of working at the company?
I loved working there! My management staff were superb!0

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Dealing with extremely large cash deposits or withdrawals. No mistKes can be made! Several crosschecks are absolutely necessary! I’m talking about amounts in excess of $100,000.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Absolutely amazing! Teamwork is the dream work there!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Happy! Love md waiting on the customers! Loved building relationships!

Great place to work.
Room for opportunity. Great work environment. They love their employees. Plenty of growth opportunities. Relocation opportunities. Team-based approach.

Mean workplace with people staying only because they want a severance package.
What is the best part of working at the company?
It used to be great place to work. Awful now with terrible customer service and leadership focused on themselves and their bonuses. Checkout the stock price for verification.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Worried about when you’ll lose your job to be replaced by someone in India.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Ruthless and mean with leaders more concerned with themselves than staff or customers.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Understaffed so working 10-12 hour days.

Decent place to work
It's a decent place to work. Pay can be better. Hours can be longer during peak reporting hours which is normal for this line of work.

Reasonable workplace
The culture here doesn't seem to be as bad as other banks and the pay is good. Feels very dry though. I am looking for a change and want something that feels invigorating

Okay place to start
Call volume is high on Mondays, Saturdays, and Fridays but it’s your typical call center.. it’s an okay place to start but not stay. This job is a stepping stone to put on your resume due to the name.

I learned a lot.
I had fun while I worked at Wells Fargo but leadership certainly had their favorites. I didn't see much growth until my first manager relocated to a different branch. From that point on the environment became much more positive. I would overhear calls with her and regional leadership where they would be yelling at her about the store's sales goals then she would bring that same energy to us on the branch floor.

Any other manager I had after that were a great deal better at managing the team and their emotions.

I was promised a managing role for several months and it never came to fruition. Once I submitted my resignation, miraculously a management position became available.

I do think they have a great professional growth plan in place but it can take some time to see yourself move up the chain. It seems to happen a lot quicker for men though.

overall fine
Good employer, good life work balance, average so-so salary. Many meetings, limited amount of people/time on coding. Old technologies (e.g., Java, Spring, Oracle, React JS )

Terrible Management
By far the most stressful job I ever had. Management had their favorites, and if you weren't one you were reminded that you are 100% replaceable on a daily basis. Also corporate looked at you exactly as your manager saw you, turn over is extremely high with this company, in addition to involuntary layoffs.

None
Management, corporate
Expectations at Wells Fargo
If you are a complete average at everything, and you like to be told what to do constantly and be micromanaged to death, this is the right place for you.

Fundamentals & opportunities
WF had thee best training ever!!! They don’t miss anything! You have to provide great customer service every time. They have a lot of opportunities to lean and grow whether it’s working in the call center or in the branch. All of my supervisors were great and really had a heart for people.

Everyday was different
Starting pay wasn’t enough
My experience was strongly impacted by the quality and caliber of management
I loved working from a contact center. Not so much at a branch. Management is driven by their team's metrics. And we are talking, there are metrics for everything! So you have to learn to be comfortable with constant monitoring of your performance. This would normally hurt team members (if metrics are not that good), but unfortunately good metrics usually do not make a big difference in your pay or opportunities to grow within the company. Technology is top of the line for sure! Being given the opportunity to work from home during the pandemic was great but I had to quit when required to go back to the office because we had to relocate to the state of Nevada (from Arizona). In general, my experience was more positive than negative. WF treated me very well when several close family members passed and I had to take time off to support my relatives. I would definitely apply again to go back to WF if I had the opportunity.

Good managers
Metrics
Great but too script d
I worked for WF for almost 7 yrs. It gave me the opportunity to grow and gain experience within the financial industry. Training at all levels is well thought out.

Cares more about customers than employees
management doesn’t really have you back and constantly contradict what they tell you in meetings and huddles. if you know the policies like the back of your hand but need approvals management will make exceptions depends on who it is or who they know

A company with a long history, complex business model, and always striving to innovate and to adapt in ever changing business world
Company went through major changes throughout my tenure. I have seen it change it’s stock ticker symbol twice from MHP to MHFI to SPI. At the same time the company focused its attention to finding and sticking to their business core which ultimately was predominantly financial services. As such, business entities such as publishing, education, broadcasting and more were spinned off and sold to the highest bidder. Along with all these changes came a mix of poor decisions and genius-like decisions. Those poor judgement ranged from the way the company outsourced or cosourced work assignments. As we all know, every major decision will affect people in one way or another. It was time well spend. I learned a lot in terms of work ethic, career enhancement, and from constant structural changes themselves.

Its a great place to be if you want to learn a lot.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Professional, thoughtful, and trusting managers.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
It’s really big, was intimidated by all the systems and technology.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Professional and courteous. Clear and concise.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Log in. Reconcile and Post. Check messages. Respond to co workers and managers. Document work flows. Report on daily tasks. Occasional meetings. Pretty much sums it up.

questions
Best employer? Committed to employees well being and growth?Great work life balance? Gives birthday off. Unlimited time off?Market competitive salaries.

Excellent place
If you get in the door, do all you can to stay there! They genuinely put people first. Compensation and benefits are unrivaled. Work isn’t terribly difficult and management stays pretty hands off unless needed.

Lot of HR Benefits, less score for challenges
If you are looking for good benefits, it is one of best company to join but in terms of the growth and challenging project; it is hard for the young employees

Manager and Senior Managers can be better
Work redundancy, but good work life balance. Independence to do work and a clear reporting structure. Good compensation and bonuses, More clear communication would be better

Great team, repetitive work
You really get to work with people all over the world, as S&P have offices everywhere. Most people work from home with a few days in the office. You can work abroad for 30 days of the year and the benefits are pretty good. Pay is okay, it depends where you are in the company. Decision making can sometimes be slow, and changes can be made quickly, it is sometimes hard to keep up with the rate of change. Working with the products can be repetitive and can limit skill development and growth.

Great work life balance
S&P has an inclusive culture with support and opportunities for advancement. They offer career coaching and mentoring along with above average pay and benefits

It's okay
Laid off within a year of employment without any additional information was blindsided by everyone involved. No one warned us just attended my weekly call and got the news

Fully remote
Was able to work on Innovative projects, was put on 2 projects, weekly 2 stand ups , new york city office was amazing, the views were great , felt good coding there

Great
My first full-time job. Great benefits, work-life balance, and good environment. As in every job, it depends on the team you have, but I was lucky and I have a really nice team with really talented people.

Good place to jumpstart a career for new graduates
I was offered this job through a contractor, and my assignment was with a company (IHS Markit) that merged with S&P Global. Not sure how the entire S&P organization is (since we merged, and not directly employed by S&P from the beginning), but the management/employees at the Andover location that were initially part IHS Markit and now S&P employees were very welcoming and nice.

As you read this, keep in mind that the organization might have re-structured the Andover location following the merger. But as far as my review at present, there were no major changes to management/employees, apart from some employees leaving in search of better opportunities. It's mostly young and new professionals who get as much out of this role as possible and then taking the next step in their career.

As far as the job goes, if you are hired by a contractor (not sure if S&P will use contractors moving forward), just know that while your role is ""Tax Analyst"" you will not be working in tax accounting, rather you will work in tax compliance.

In my opinion, it is not very intellectually demanding job. For me, It was really exciting for the first 3-6 months but then it got monotonous. This is not to say that you will not work hard; there are a lot of daily tasks, checking tax forms for accuracy and completeness, and making sure the information complaint with tax laws. But, ultimately it's pretty much data entry all day. There will be high volumes of forms coming in where you will have to analyze the form and enter the data into the system.

You will be trained on the S&P side pertaining to tax laws,

Good workplace but some managers mess it
Good place to work. Career advancement opportunities should be better and clear. Management needs to be less bossy as they can play with your careers for their ego.

Good first job
Good first job after college. Lot to learn. Great benefits. Great work culture. low pay. Long hours. Alot of work drama.



Great benefits, but career growth
In consulting, there is talk of growth, but it seems like it is still limited. Interesting opportunities are given more to those recently hired and past problems have yet to be fixed. Most people work at home still and company benefits are good.

Extreme instability and lack of communication ruin otherwise great company
2017-2022 was a period of non-stop mergers, acquisitions, and lay-offs. No one knew what was really going on or whether their job was safe. I was moved to different managers/teams three times without any consultation. They also told hundreds of people that they eventually laid off that they would have new jobs at the company. Leadership prioritizes buzzwords and rosy assessments that do not reflect the state of the organization at all. ""Organization"" is really not a word that should be used here. All this aside, if you can stomach putting it aside, it was a good place to work. Co-workers were great, diversity was strong, pay/benefits and work flexibility was very good. Shame the management was so poor.

Great pay, benefits, work/life balance
Poor management, poor communication, disorganized leadership and heavy siloing
Good company with good benefits
Good pay. A modern company with really good benefits. The culture was great with forward thinking management, at least in my area. I can't really speak for other areas

Great place to work
S&P is a very good place to work. Management is decent and receptive to new ideas (at least as far as bigger organizations go). Colleagues are high caliber and enjoy a decent work/life balance.

Productive workplace
Top ratings agency so lot of opportunities to work on various systems and getting in tune with latest technologies and methodologies required for progress in your career

Good Company with Good Benefits
The organization really is ahead in caring for their employees with the best benefits I’ve seen. The leadership team is strong and cares about their employees and takes the time to listen to them.

Great team to work with
What is the best part of working at the company?
The Denver team management. they were very important to the growth of this department and the success of the team.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
impatient clients who choose not to learn how the platform functions but to only want answers and no trainings.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
family friendly team management approach

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
8 hours of answering and training clients on the phone. helping new associates understand corporate finance and accounting.

High Growth, Best Tech
Best place to learn how to sell...Excellent technology, strong marketing department. Base Pay was decent but definitely a place to stay for a couple years and then leave so that you can come back at a higher base


Powerful company - yes and no
The company was great, incredible offices, team, etc. Pray you have a good manager, I ended up being pushed out because of mine. She completely ruined my experience in sales here

Thanks for your review- we're sorry that you had that experience but are glad to hear there were positives that you enjoyed during your tenure. We want all of our employees to feel valued and supported by their leadership and management teams, so know that your feedback will be seen by the right people to ensure issues like this are addressed. Thank you again for taking the time to share.

Good company with great people but changing
Overall a good work experience but left do changing environment after getting too large which lead to a lot of overlap and politics. Pay and benefits are top notch

Too stressed and no assistance from Management.
I think the company is a good overall company. However the department I work in is not a great place to work. In my department only the lazy people get promoted and recognized. Makes those of us that work hard every day feel pretty deflated.

Management
Good learning ground. High pressure environment that is not for everyone.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Opportunity to do a lot of different things and the pay is at the top of the industry especially in sales roles

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Sales Role - High pressure sales is encourage and nurtured. Accounts get swapped out every year which doesn't allow you to develop deep relationships with the customer. Dilutes the engagement

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Fast paced. High pressure. Depending on where in SF you work, this can be different.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Typical high pressure sales environment when you are always chasing deals and building pipeline. The two most imporantant metrics (ACV and Pipe)

Good company
Very happy to join this high growth company. Worked there for 1 year plus. Good training and opportunity. There are good managers, lots of diversity and inclusion.

Great place to start
Salesforce is a good company that will provide you with strong sales training. Be prepared to focus on net new business as that is what is most sought after

Great culture and colleagues, collaborative and great package
Highly collaborative culture, open communication, great colleagues and a really good package. Well organised, team of high professionals. Innovative products, dynamic environment.
Work-life balance can be challenging.

Great values but short-sighted
Great civic engagement and genuine caring about employees, but not focused enough (anymore) on longer-term investments over short-term profits. Over-corrected over the last year

Professional services
Salesforce Professional Services tries its best but falls short. It is a stress, pressure cooker with frequent changes in reporting structure. Saleforce bought Acumen and has become a lowly, no-culture, Acumen bean counter company

Great Product and Pay, but..
Their CRM product has a lot of industry acceptance. CEO knows how to keep Wall Street happy. So called culture of high performance means that PIPs are being widely encouraged.

Really hard to hit quota YoY
Really hard to hit quotas. Only cares about numbers. Seen really great AE’s exceed quota one year and then be let go the next. Most accounts are looking for cost savings are we get more expensive.

Just not good
Working here you really are treated like another number. I was at DreamForce and tried to shake big boss hand and he ghosted me. Overrated company, not good

Great place to work
Great experience and you learn a TON very fast. Challenging to grasp all the products but managers and team set you up for success and great career progression opportunities

Great Company
Salesforce has amazing benefits, opportunities for growth, and an emphasis on work life balance. However, I found that there were extremely unreasonable expectations put on Business Development Representatives during early Covid shutdowns where businesses were suffering and sales slowed down. The entire world changed, and Salesforce should have adapted to that.

Some organizational issues
I'd say there was very unclear mentorship goals and that there were issues with training their more junior engineers. I would recommend associates try another company.

Productive
Great place to work and learn strongly recommend especially for new as well and experienced professionals good management and staff very friendly colleagues

Very fun place to work
loved my experience
really nice product; challenging and amazing work to do. was able to work remotely which was even better for my experience. loved the office too!

Best company
I have never loved my job more. it is a great work environment in a beautiful office centrally located in Chicago. The company truly adheres to its values.

One of the best places to work in
I had the privilege of working as a QA professional at Salesforce, and my experience with the company has been nothing short of exceptional. Salesforce is an organization that exudes a commitment to excellence, innovation, and a genuine care for its employees, which has made it a truly remarkable place to work.

One of the standout aspects of Salesforce is its unwavering dedication to employee growth and development. The company places a strong emphasis on continuous learning, providing numerous opportunities for skill enhancement and career advancement. Whether it's through comprehensive training programs, mentorship initiatives, or access to cutting-edge tools and technologies, Salesforce empowers its employees to thrive in a dynamic and ever-evolving industry.

Moreover, the work culture at Salesforce is one of the most welcoming and inclusive I've ever encountered. The company not only values diversity but actively fosters an environment where every voice is heard and celebrated. This inclusivity isn't just a buzzword; it's deeply ingrained in the company's DNA.

Salesforce's commitment to social responsibility is equally commendable. The organization champions various philanthropic initiatives, encouraging employees to give back to the community. This sense of purpose, of contributing to something larger than ourselves, is truly motivating.



Ok work culture
I could not feel the connect with the company. May be I was at fault. I dont know. Detailed training needs to be given to new employee. It is very important

What is the best part of working at the company?

Things are great until...
Be careful who you trust. Program manager is great until unpopular action or support is needed. Willing to put up with lackluster employees if they are part of the club. A lot of talking behind each others back...very juvenile.

Lots of food
No support from ""leadership""
Could utilize intelligence analyst better
Interesting work and great people. Would like to see the analyst utilized in a better way rather than in a minute capacity. Also have a bit more intelligence invested into the actual position.

Management, workplace culture
You are a number, even though you are on the front lines carrying the GDIT banner. Management is lost in their entitlement positions and no guidance or feedback. I’ve served in the military for over 20 plus years and when a PM ask me how do I connect to the troops or promised to reach out during a challenging personal time, is this the right place to spend your talents?

Nothing

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Taking calls from sick old people that have for some reason lost their insurance. Not being able to help them made my soul bleed.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Very stressful. They harp on one call resolution and then get nasty when your call times are too long.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Clock in. Take call after call. You have to pre sign-off just to get a few minutes to go to the bathroom because calls are back to back. Breaks are too short. Employees steal your lunch from the cafeteria and no one will do anything to get your lunch box or mug back.

Great

Good job, good pay, great benefits
I worked for General Dynamics IT as a contractor for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The GDIT folks are first-class: they get you a computer, make sure you go to orientation and answer any questions about benefits. My health insurance kicked in on my first day of work. No complaints.

okay
I really don't have anything to say good or bad about the company. The company ARMA Global was consumed by GDIT a few years ago and we lost some great benefits


GDIT is an inclusive non discriminatory company to work for. Everyone was included and heard from, when we had a concern.
GDIT had a pleasant working environment.
Management always made themselves available to answer our questions and concerns. While I was with the company, they showed empathy and care for their employees. I would say it is a good company to work for.

Caring and competitive salaries company
Headquarters are in a different state.
Great place to work
Great place to work, and allows for one to express themselves in their work, they support individuality and have a super diverse team and work ethic ! I’ve had the pleasure learning about their networking capabilities which allows one to secure their career safely even in uncertain times. Which some companies do not have at all. Pay is great! The company benefits excel any other company’s and I think most negative comments are very repetitive in the date and could be from other competitors. So beware of review bombing! If you are looking for a career to thrive and be the pioneer you were destined to be, this is the place.

Competitive pay, Excellent benefits, great support
Competitors bombing reviews
Not a Healthy Place to work
Very poor leadership - toxic micro-management. Great pay and benefits. Was treated very poorly privately by my manager, and leadership structure was such where I had no safe option other then to leave for my mental well being.

Good pay bad atmosphere
The atmosphere was toxic. Good pay but phones had to be locked up, there were no windows, and hours were bad. They had a photo of a tree on the wall to brighten up the room but still very dark

It was a good learning experience.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The best part about working here is the benefits package is fairly decent and they we’re understanding about my health issues and worked with me around them.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The most stressful part is non-stop phones calls to the point that couldn’t even catch my breath and being tied to desk non-stop for 8+ hours a day. Also when it was your time to go home, you couldn’t leave if you were on a call, and that call could be 2 minutes or it could end up being an hour.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
I didn’t like that there was no sunlight to be seen except if you could the door so it made it dreary. Talking was sort of discouraged because of people being on calls. I did like that they hire people from all walks of life!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
A typical day is back to back calls and figuring out is it a transfer to another department, just a data entry, an account update, an account triage, or getting chewed out for something you had nothing to do with.

Quick money with job sign on
Answering questions about insurance. Learned how to do sales over the phone. Management doesn't care because about everyone is temporarily employed even though it says full time. Strict you have to stay at your seat and answer phones. To answer call after call with no time in between besides scheduled breaks. The pay is decent.





you can schedule time off
they might say full time but it's really temporary
In 7 years of contracting work it was the most unpleasant work environment I have been a part of.

Work life balance
Capgemini cares about their employee's overall well being. Great work life balance. Great place to work. I learned so much in my various consultant roles.

Good for initial consulting experience - but not longterm
Started my consulting journey straight out of college. Stayed at Capgemini for 3 years then knew it was time to go. Lots of delays with promotions for people at all levels and projects can get repetitive so it is easy to get into your comfort zone and never leave.

Worst WFH Job Ever
They monitor your every move. You have to be active constantly with no work to do. They expect you to know how to solve problems that you were not trained to deal with. My manager was very unprofessional, left early everyday, would leave you hanging during training, but then be angry and very aggressive if you did not solve issues that you were not trained to do. PTO was a task to deal with. HR is awful to get in contact with. No promotions. You do not get paid well. Contractors let go every other day with no explanation. People hired & fired every week. Training is watching videos and listening to another companies calls.

Wfh, Pto, Benefits
Micromanagement, Training, Pay, Stability
Learn as much as you can and get out as fast as you can!
Everything is a fire drill with a severe lack of planning. Anything I learn is on my own.

Management is abysmal. The misogyny is blatant yet all you ever hear about is diversity.

The culture promotes (or claims to) a speak up culture. Sure. Speak up and you’re conveniently terminated. Intimidation, fear and outright bullying run rampant here. That’s the hardest part of the job. Putting up with this garbage.

Your immediate coworkers if you’re lucky. Training.
Look above. Too many to mention.
Horrible Place
Unorganized place, let me just say this - I was there for 2 years and leadership changed 4 times. What does that you? I would not recommend this company.

Stressful depends on the client you are working for
What is the best part of working at the company?

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Worst Account teams, more importance to revenue generate than adding value to a client.

Not good; senior management always talk about how to place more resources to your assigned client

good and good and good and good all good in this company i have learned a lot and got great exposure in all sorts of technologies. so better to work in this company

Outdated
Lots of overtime and dated upper management. No real growth opportunities. Experience varies greatly depending on your team and direct manager. Benefits are abysmal.

Consulting company
I’m currently working on something that has nothing to do with my position and is a lot of high demand and stress in the area that I’m working on I think they offer you training as a high position but just to fill in the gaps on the positions no body wants

west of time to work hear , poor management and HR
they dont value people all their policies are only on papers but in reality there are no work ethics , management is really poor , HR is arrogant, stressful work culture .

nice office infrastructure
no increments, no job security, stress full life, poor work culture
Cool
Good place to work. Less work pressure. Late night calls as you will be working mostly with Us clients . Supportive team. Less yearly hike. Slow to no growth

Bad experience
No learning opportunities, bad hikes, stay for 2 yrs and then switch is the best option. Avoid unless who have no other options. Managers are egoistic, make you work like a donkey & in the end give you peanuts during appraisals.



Great Place to Work
Great Place to work that has a nice work to life balance. I was apart of the tech layoffs but there was also a lack of work and production around that time. But great place to work anyway

I regret to say that my experience at Capgemini has been far from satisfactory. I joined as a Support Engineer with high hopes, but several critical issues have led me to give this review the lowest possible rating of 1 star.

First and foremost, the compensation for Support Engineers at Capgemini is far below average. The pay scale is not competitive with industry standards, making it difficult to make ends meet, let alone feel valued for the work put in.

Moreover, the lack of benefits is a major concern. In an era where employee well-being is a top priority for many companies, Capgemini falls short in providing essential benefits that can greatly improve the overall work experience.

Another frustrating aspect is the constant outsourcing to unfamiliar companies. This not only creates a sense of instability but also leaves employees feeling disconnected from the core values and culture of Capgemini.

Perhaps the most concerning issue is the lack of responsiveness from Capgemini itself. Sending emails to the company rarely results in any meaningful communication or resolution of concerns. It feels like you're left in the dark with no avenue for addressing issues or seeking assistance.

Overall, my time at Capgemini has been marked by disappointment, with below-average compensation, a lack of benefits, constant outsourcing, and a frustrating lack of responsiveness from the company itself. I sincerely hope these issues are addressed to improve the experiences of future employees.

Boss was genuine, Almost feel like an employee until you look at your paycheck
Below average compensation, rare WFM opportunities, Atrocious benefits, little to zero communication towards Vendors
Typical consulting - create a buzz to be recognized
If you would like to train your manager who knows much less than you while being underpaid then this is the place for you. Many people leave and return to get their true value paid to them.

Great WFH
If you want to work from home, Capgemini is a good choice. Their time keeping system is prehistoric and they are very disorganized but my supervisor was very nice.

great opportunities and work life balance. hybrid working , very good management and multiple technologies ,so many clients

Great Environment to learn and grow
Great place to start your career in Software Engineering. They provide training and you are surrounded by talented team members. Pay needs improvement though.

Good place to work
Great place to work if there are projects. Unfortunately, I was laid off due to lack of projects. Had an amazing time while working, and got some certs while on the bench.

Good ole boy toxic cut throat conspiracy
Some departments are great and then you get to one thats not. HR, Business Conduct and Mgmt are an alliance against the employees. Do not report violations or toxicity to any of them or you are a target. They can ruin your life. They have the power to change the outcome of your career and will do so together. You don't have a chance against them. There is no consistency across departments. Some departments respect you, allow you to use your benefits, do your job and for the most part dont bother you. Other departments get away with just about anything. The phrase, ""Supervisors discretion"" or ""Managers discretion"" is just that. Unprofessional, if you end up under one of those types you are SOL. Save your mental health and keep looking elsewhere.

I loved it there!
So sad i had to leave Capital one but this is by far the best company I’ve ever worked for. I have nothing bad to say about this company. From the day i became an employee they treated me like family every where i went. I work at the jrc location & the environment was different from what i was use to. Everyone was pretty cool most supervisors were helpful and the co workers was cool as also. When everything happened with COVID they were quick to respond. When things were in the media about BLM they were quick to respond in a positive understanding way. Love it. However If you are planning to work in collections please know you need to have patience and bring your A game to collect money.

Good Entry Level
This position is a good entry level position, but the bonus structure & pay are low. The management could do with some revision to make goals and company mission clearer.

It was good at first when there was more people working . They kept letting people go and making it harder for current employees
What is the best part of working at the company?
The PTO and pay had to be the best part. The training is very good but half of the stuff is not needed (camera was optional)

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Busy busy call volumes. Company always changing policies . Metrics are super important but stressful. They have 8-9 metrics you have to meet . Failure to meet even one could result in termination.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
If you want to matter within the company, you have to really show it.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
35-40 calls back to back all day.

Great company
Good company , great benefit , great culture hours is good
management is not great
Promotion is almost not possible,You stuck in your position for ever

Fun and easy
As long as you can count and work a computer, you'll be fine. Of course have great customer service skills or learn to have them. The benefits are amazing.

As expected of a large company
For a large company, Capital One does well in taking care of their employees. Understandably, their compensation is not top-tier but it is sufficient for the amount of work/hours that is expected.

Productive and fun workplace
Very good company to work for. Everything was easy to learn and they are willing to train you. Only downside some branches in the surrounding areas open on a Saturday

Not bad overall
Overall it is a good company to work for. The company has good benefits and supports employee growth through online learning, workshops, etc.

Reorgs, employee shuffling and knee jerk decisions in some tech groups has led to low moral and uncertainty.

Hands down best employer in Richmond VA
You are in control of your success at Capital One. The recruiting team does an amazing job of hiring top talent, with both technical and soft skills. You will be surrounded by intelligence which can push you to be your best self. It’s a little competitive, at cross calibrations aren’t easy given the high bar of talent across the organization. That said, I personally will take a difficult cross calibration because I’m surrounded by excellence every single time over the alternative.

The people make the company.

Benefits and facilities are top notch.

Energetic and fun workplace
This was a college job for me, many of my co workers went to SCSU as did I. Fun atmosphere, the job was taking inbound calls for Capital One 360. The job is what you’d expect, but the company treats the employees very well. Nice coffee machine too!

Productive and fun environment
I have found my time at capital one to be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling. The company's commitment to innovation and excellence has provided me with numerous opportunities for professional growth and development.
I have had the privilege of working alongside talented and supportive colleagues who have not only fostered a collaborative environment but also inspired me to push the boundaries of my own capabilities. The management team has consistently shown a genuine interest in the well-being and career progression of their employees, creating a positive and motivating workplace culture.

Additionally, the company's emphasis on work-life balance and flexible scheduling has allowed me to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my professional and personal life. I am truly grateful for the experiences and knowledge gained during my time at capital one.

fun working place until covid
It was a great company until covid then it became micro managed. Lots of standing and community outreach. I gained so many skills at my time here. It's really what you make it.

Nah
No thanks. Horrible pay. Not properly compensated for additional work. Always want you to go above and beyond for a pat on the back. Was a stable position, but overall, felt taken advantage of.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Log in work attend 5 different meetings that take you away from your core role and then later in the week your yelled at for failing in your performance/metrics

Survivor-like experience
Working there is like an episode of Survivor. At the end of the day someone has to be kicked off the island due to their stack ranking performance management process. Colleagues play the game to win and take steps to ensure they are still standing. Then, the process starts all over again and those remaining compete against one another because the next round of eliminations quickly approaches. This is one of the most stressful workplaces I have ever seen. The answer is to have financial independence so that you do not need to depend on this (or any) employer.

Lost in Transition
Company doesn't know what it wants to become. They stress that they're a FinTech company, but they hired a bunch of former Alexa castoffs to lead their product org and direction. Pay is does not correlate to hours put in- so expect to work 60+hours and on weekends. Also very cut throat and passive aggressive culture. Products are non-existent and lacking from a PM view.

Tough times
Performance management is very tough at the moment. Forced distribution with stakes ranking. Job security and return to office are the two main drivers of dissatisfaction

Best company I have ever worked for
Wonderful company with great benefits. You don’t feel like just another number here, they really make you feel valued as an employee. Management is the best I have ever experienced with any job.

They don’t throw you to the fire, they make sure you’re well trained.
Training is extremely long (for a good reason)

Good culture, can get boring
Great culture, coworkers, and opportunities for growth. Lots of phone time and not much opportunity to get out of a phone based role quickly. The pay is decent for what you are asked to do.

Great work
Awesome benefits and pay is solid. Job growth is ok but there are a lot of different avenues you can take so it can be overwhelming if you’re not sure

Underpaid and unrelenting
A terrible job if you value your mental health. Stay away. Always monitored and expected to make calls one right after the other. Extremely rude customers as well.

Fun at work
Excellent place to work and grow. The work life balance is good and company perks are excellent. Though there salary is not at par but not too low as well

Fun Work Environment
Very knowledgeable staff and great place to work. Good work life balance and unlimited growth potential within the company. Highly recommend for those entering the industry

Great company
Great company with good PTO and team dynamic. I also enjoy the benefits in the student loan benefit. However, do keep in mind that Fidelity ‘s pay is lower compared to other financial companies, but they do take in consideration of worklife balance

401k reviewer
Not sure if location is open anymore. Worked there 3 years in early 2000’s. People were nice, managers were nice. Pay was not great but that was a long time ago.

Great place to work!
Good work-life balance, good pay, good bonuses, great support. True definition of if you just show up and do your job, you’ll do well and go far. The only way this job becomes bad is when you’re being micromanaged. But that only happens when you’re not doing the basic things you’re suppose to be doing.

Good opportunity not for me.
Good work culture, a lot of volume, just not cut out to work in an office myself. If you can handle being on the phone and working in an office setting behind a computer all day I recommend it for you.

Great company, stressful role
Fidelity as a whole is an amazing company to work for. I do feel supported daily, but the call volume can be extremely exhausting. It’s a look of pressure and easy to feel burnt out. Thankfully I have a great manager who is kind and understanding.

Great company to work for
Phone roles can be a grind. There are some days that I really dislike my job but that's more of an indicator of the job itself rather than the company. Fidelity is a great company to work for and they really care about their associates. If you are thinking of going for a service representative phone role, Fidelity is a great place to do it

Great
They really go above and beyond with training. Mine was 4 months. The volume can be difficult yet I always have felt supported enough to handle it. Overall great.

Location and Manager Dependent
Fidelity is good place to work with the understanding of the type of company you are working for and the location you are working at. The job is basically a bank teller with no financial representation functions. You learn the operations end of the transactions but not much more. Depending on your location and operations manager this can be a good or bad experience. Also, the clientele of each location is different with some locations having a more relaxed clientele and some, like Irvine, with a more intense/stressed clientele. To move into a higher role takes time and all but a few financial advisors seem miserable and over worked in trying to bring in new money constantly so moving up doesn’t seem that appealing. Overall, it is a very controlled corporate environment where every move you make is monitored and recorded. You can make money but it is hit and miss on how satisfying the experience will be.

Great people jobs not for me
Fidelity has a lot of great benefits and if you enjoy talking to people on phones all day this is for you. The onboarding progress is long however it would be hard to slim it down with the licensing. The pay is also not very good for the amount of work you do.

Many opportunities
Been with fidelity for 7 years , straight out of college. Had 3 career changes in that time, with much support from managers. Only con is having to go into the office for a week a month. Other than that, no complaints. Decent pay and great benefits.

Great support and advancement opportunities
Highly recommend fidelity as an employer. Great benefits, work life balance, and professional development and advancement.
Only con is shift availability and times aren’t always the greatest.

Good Benefits, No Advancement
There are certain jobs within the company that are simply too valuable to let you move. If you were competing for a role that you desire, and it came down to you and someone in service, the service person will get it. The advancement offered by this position is either management or a higher tier in the same role. As told by managers within the company: ""Once you are in this dept, it is easier to apply to a different position from the outside, not the inside.""

Good entry into Finance
They will help you study for the SIE, 7, and 66 licenses. You have 2 attempts to pass the SIE (it’s the easiest exam outta the 3 and should pass on both attempts). 3 attempts for the 7 and 66. The support received is alright. Training is not the best as the coaching/role plays are pointless. Majority of the job is processing 401k transactions via phone. You have to watch what you say and how you say certain words as well. Promotions are…to put it lightly instance once you get all licenses. However, your manager has to like you to even be considered for a WPC 2-3 position.

Call centers are not for everyone
Fidelity Investments is a call center company focused on financial markets and investing. You have to pass your securities license exam and obtain your series 6 or7 and potentially other licensures to work there long term. Fidelity is very supportive of you getting these licenses, but in the end it is a call center. If you want to work in a call center and take 8 - 12 calls per hour, this might be a good fit. You're on the phone all day long and you're held to a series of high customer service and operational standards. If you think you might like this sort of thing, great. If this isn't the life for you, just know what you're getting into.

Awesome place to work!
Best place for advancement and growth. Their benefits and pay are amazing. They have the work life balance that cares for families. I would recommend Fidelity to anyone looking for a place to start their career.

Revature-8,"




Bad pay
The pay was something I think. I don't really know what happened as I don't think I even got hired really but something or other was going on when things where happening

Predatory, frustrating experience.
If you get a position with Revature, they train you in whatever they feel like, regardless of any experience you may have, and you have no say in what you get trained in. Training is intense and the trainers are middling at best. Revature also failed to land contracts for most of my training group for ServiceNow, thus ending with most of us being released swiftly, failing to deliver on their promises. This may not be the same experience with other tech stacks for training, but since you have no choice in what you are trained in it's not a risk worth taking. Plus, you don't get to duck out after the first 10 days of training, by which point you likely still are being trained in an 'introductory' course with no relation to the final subject youll be trained in and expected to interview for. So really, overall this is a trap, not worth it.


1
Put on Client then left and forgotten
The 12-week training was easily the highlight of the job, I had a great trainer and batch of co-workers. The issue comes with the predatory contract and lack of any real resources. I had a training group of 15 people, 10 of them including myself were onboarded with a Client Cognizant, 1 with another client, and the other 4 were laid off after a single client interview, one of which lasted all of 5 seconds. We were all remote which is great but not common at all, Revature will force you to move with little to no warning or financial help. The 10 of us went through Cognizant training which went great, and then got distributed to another client. That's where the issues came from. Only 2 people are still with Revature and Cognizant, everyone else was assigned a client, left to themselves for months at a time, and then promptly let go with no warning. I spent about 7 months doing nothing, with no communication from any source, and then thrown away. This can be made worse for those who were forced to move across the country and abandoned. If you decide to not move across the country for a client and leave, the price to break the contract was around 30K. Please do not work here, all coding boot camps are predatorial and disgusting. Trainers are great and just people trying to do good.

Great resources for learning
Everything else, do not work here

5
High promises, low effort
The training was good and the coworkers are similar likeminded people so no problems there. However, they promised to find us client projects to deploy to however the management was lazy and we were left in staging for over a month before being let go. Very disappointing.

Great trainer and coworkers
Bad management
you learn a lot
the best part of revature was definitely the batch mates and the trainer. you will learn a lot and the projects are really fast-paced. I would recommend learning as much as you can about what you are going to learn. I would say avoid revature if you can. it was a lot of work but it didn't pay off. only one person in my batch got an actual job with Revature and everyone else was laid off. half of us never got one interview and being on the bench was a huge waste of time. do not do it unless you are desperate.

Fairly decent
Bootcamp style atmosphere. Project based and after 3 months you interview with clients for a slightly better wage. This shouls only be your choice if youre desperate to get into tech and don;t mind being broke initially.

Productive, but can be stressful work. Depending on the client
It started off fun and engaging, and I was learning a lot through the training they provided at the beginning. But once I got with the client, things got very unorganized and I was left to figure things out on my own. Work became stressful and the team hardly communicated.

Training is good, but could be better.
The training was good overall because Revature provides a solid base for what we need to know in order to land a client, but it is organized poorly in my opinion.

Great way to get your foot in the door!
Wonderful place to work. I learned so much and met some really good people. I will be lifelong friends with a lot of them. Revature taught me so much.



Nice place
I like it because it helps me to improve my confident and I end up to be kicked out from the program. It’s a very rigorous program, l learnt C# and SQL

A great place to work that gives opportunity to Entry Level devs
Regardless of what might be said about Revature, it remains one of the companies out there that is willing to give an opportunity to folks who might not have any to gain technical knowledge and interview with top notch clients/companies. Yes you get paid minimum wage during training, but that is public knowledge. It really is a place that you have to see if it's a good fit or not for you.

fun workplace
During a challenging period of limited opportunities, they excelled by having numerous partners who could provide valuable connections. However, the downside lies in the contract, which is the major drawback.

it's a gamble
the training they provide is decent, but very hard. If you go into this with little knowledge of coding, you are going to struggle and possibly get kicked or dropped. About half of our class was dropped. After completing the course, you may or may not end up working with a client. For me and others, it was about luck. We all had interviews with the same client. The first two who had their interview were selected, all other interviews were cancelled.

More of a training camp
10am to 6pm on minimum wage, the industry isn't great so you most likely won't get a long term job. It isn't useless but don't rely on the idea of getting a job. Focus on adding things to your GitHub/personal profile so you can get a job when they let you go after training.

Crushed dreams
Revature starts you at minimum wage based on your location, and trains you in what they call a ""tech stack"". Training is fine and kind of fun, but you can't slack through it. If your first project won't run, you're out. You'll go through what they call QC every week, where you will be grilled. You will be tested on things not discussed in training, so you have to study. If you bomb to many QCs you're out.
After training is what they call Staging. Where you are waiting for an interview. Even in Staging the training doesn't stop, though now the training is in client on interviews. If they can't get you an interview within two weeks of completing training they let you go. Its the most crushing thing I've ever experienced. After making it through training and QC, "" oh we can't find a client for you, so we are letting you go"" without any further explanation.

Good company as the last option to get into IT
Job posts state many locations onsite across the US, however, the training os conducted remotely. Read carefully your contract. They give you a 5-day contract opt-out without obligations in case the training does not meet your obligations. For those without programming fundametals, the training may be overwhelming, and they will break the contract early due insufficient performance. Overall, their concept is not bad but could be improved.

A way to get your foot in the door but definitely not the best choice for everybody
This company is a way to get your foot in the door if you're out of options. Diverse environment and a good idea in theory. The execution could be improved. They offer you the chance to connect with clients and that can happen if you work really hard but it's not exactly a stable option; especially now.

Last option available to you
Training and the instructors were solid and that's just about where it ends sadly apart from a few other good staff from working with there.

You train and sit on the bench waiting for a client at minimum wage, once getting a client you are then docked a quarter of your pay for the first year ""to pay back the instructor"" for 3 months of training.

WILL NOT RETRAIN if they are unable to find you a client or another one after being released from. I and a few others in my batch raised this exact concern from the start and was assured that this would never happen but exactly this did happen to a few of us in our own batch where they would rather just lay off.

Communication is lacking between staff and often times your emails to them will be ignored.

Clients can drag their feet on interviewing and accepting your contract for over a month+, so you're essentially stuck in limbo until such time. Clients can also require you to move to the state then just as quickly release you from them meaning you're now stuck in a new state.

training, health care
lack of communication, job security
Not bad
Revature has really great trainers, but I noticed that a majority of people already had CS degrees. I, unfortunately, was at a huge disadvantage because I needed a pre-training program to help me and I wasn't placed in it. They also don't tell you your tech stack, so it is hard to prepare for it. They use a lot of Java. Being a beginner coder, it was hard for me to grasp. It is nice because they do pay you minimum wage, but if you begin falling behind, you will be screwed.

Ruins its workers’ lives
Garbage company. The skills I learned there were mostly useless. Gave up my 50k job to work minimum wage for 6 months. Their hiring stats are 100% bogus sales pitch. More like 10 % selected, 90 % let go. Revature like all Indian IT companies will put its American workers into poverty. Even if you’re hired and relocated, the pay bump won’t cover rent.

Don’t gamble your future away with this company b/c you’ll probably be let go in 6 moths. Complete suckage.

Paid training
Post training activities, poverty pay, silly interview practice"

Nice Office and living in San Jose
It was pretty good. I am from San Jose so it was nice to be at home. Pretty secluded location for the office which is nice at times because you are often going against traffic.

Productive and Educational
The program was a great way to start my corporate career. After the interview process we were placed into groups where we trained for 9 months at various locations on the IBM sales process. Was able to network and was ultimately placed in a high profile role. Really enjoyed the experience overall

leading edge tech firm
Decent pay with a lot of challenging work. Large number of coworkers helps you learn from a lot of people with a wide range of experience and skill sets.

Able to move around
Great opportunity to move around the company such as sales, consulting, internal jobs, etc. benefits are ok but similar to other large companies. Would recommend

Good work life balance
Lot of room for good advancement. Good work life balance and corporate culture. Would recommend company to anyone looking for a stable work environment.

good work
good team and people are ready to help everyone in the team. work life balance is good. impressive tech stack and cloud computing is highly used across teams

Strong Upward Mobility For The Right Person
For a self-starter who knows what they want out of a career, IBM Consulting is a fantastic launchpad for a career. If you are someone who can advocate for yourself and your skills, you'll have boundless opportunity for upward advancement.

Large Company with depth of professionalism
IBM has been committed to the values of Dedication to every client's success. Innovation that matters. Trust and personal responsibility in all for 100+ years. This has looked different over the decades but has remained consistent.

The deep professionalism is remarkable and not found in all organizations.

It is a HUGE corporate organization, and will that comes the challenges of corporate life. Getting experience in this size of organization is invaluable.

Flexibility and deep professionalism
Downsizing
love it
I love coming to my job and it's alot of growth within the company to exceed over and beyond. There are no issues as I been with the company for more than five years.

Decent place to grow and make new connections
Overall it's a decent place to work. Where the stress can come in is when you're seeking a new project to land when there are hundreds of others doing the same thing. It's looking for a job in your job.

You do have a multitude of training and educational options at your fingertips.

Wonderful people - poor leadership
I was impacted by a company wide reduction in workforce. I suspect this plan was in motion a year before it was implemented. History shows this is how leadership responds to their mistakes.

Highly Team Dependent, But I Enjoyed It
Your experience at IBM is highly team dependent because it is both an aging legacy company that is pivoting into consultancy while also a tech company. The first team I was on was a bit of a dumpster fire, but the pay was decent and the work life balance was excellent. My second team was more tech focused and technical, and I loved working with my coworkers. If you work remote and are ok with slightly below market pay, IBM is not a bad place to be at all.

Productive
It's a decent company to work for. Flexible hours and reasonable management. Often, heavy workload in support desk. Pay is not always up to industry standard and is typically on the low side.

Good and bad
Hard to advance when you are internal and not client facing, not paid at market rate. Leadership makes you perform the role for a year before promotion is given along with compensation.

pretty good
“Overall, I enjoyed my experience with IBM. I learned a lot about how working in the corporate world. The workplace culture was great, everyone worked individually to complete assignments but was required to also work as a team for the completion of other work tasks.” 1
“Good company and can work from home. I enjoyed going into the office as well since this is where I met most of my good friends. The culture is tough and you have be on top of your game.” 1
“Fun to work for and great team environment. Check for accuracy of amounts to be paid and entered all A/P amounts in their appropriate accounts into the computer software system, and assisted other employees who fell behind on their work load.” 1
“My typical day at IBM consisted of conducting technical and operational analysis of capital spending, budgeting, and tracking using advanced accounting application modules within SAP and its feeder subsystems, Capital Tracking Facility and Ledger Systems. I was basically analyzing and interpreting complex data identification of issues and development of alternate courses of action with recommended solutions. Overall, I enjoyed my experience with IBM. I learned a lot about how working in the corporate world. The workplace culture was great, everyone worked individually to complete assignments but was required to also work as a team for the completion of other work tasks.” 1
I hope this helps!

Fun workplace and atmosphere
people are ok to work with. Lots of room for growth an dopportunity. Workload can be overwhelming at times. It is importannt to take advantage of the PTO available.

Good place to work
The company provides excellent training opportunities for new employees. The work was interesting. One issue is that the company is not very good at knowing when to let people go instead, they have a tendency to move. People laterally into a position where they can’t cause more harm.

Awesome
I worked at IBM for 25 years before the spin off to Kyndryl, It was an amazing experience traveling , learning and working with a lot of great folks. I will always cherish those memories

Awsome workplace to grow your skills.
With IBM your growth is your limit. The ability to transfer from one division to another is one of the best. Every year you are given a stipend to learn new things. Sometimes mandatory but it is always about cutting edge.

Pros and Cons
Remote work was great. Coworkers were great. Direct management team was great but I felt unappreciated most of the time by upper management. Great quote by a fellow employee, “Nothing changes but change.”

Happily Retired
I had worked at IBM for many years, but retired recently. Enjoyed it tremendously as a training associate. Am now retired and enjoying life tremendously for now.

Great benefits and work life balance
Offers competitive salary with great benefits and work life balance. Good work as well!

Very employee friendly and focused. Good culture and management.

Great Overall
For such a large company, its been great to have good experiences with basically everyone I've worked with. Great enablement and benefits/PTO allowance.

Broadcom ruined everything
Used to be a wonderful place to work. Easily the best job I ever had. Broadcom came in and flipped everything upside down. I was offered a transition role but can not wait to get out.

Was a great company
VMware was an innovative company in technology and in people. Great benefits and diversity. Unfortunately, from what I hear that is all gone with the new acquisition.

Great Company
VMware is a start company that cares about employees frist, revenue second. It is clearly visible when another compared to another company's values and culture.

VMW was a great company
VMW was a great, albeit imperfect, company. The culture was incredible and unique. Sadly, now that VMW has been purchased by Broadcom that culture is dying a slow death for those who transitioned into the new company.

Great people
So many great people doing great work. Before the Broadcom acquisition anyways, work life balance was great, nothing bad to say. I would have recommended it. After the acquisition... Time will tell

Fun and great place
A great place to work. People are genuinely interested in doing what’s right and helping others. Very open on working environment and schedule, competitive slaaory

Excellent company with excellent benefits
Truly employee friendly company. Pros:
Everyone has a voice, decision making happens bottom up for a lot of things
Cons:
The same can be a con as well as for everything you need to debate


Was a great place to work
Having just been bought by Broadcom I can't say what the values will be going forward. In the past, however, VMware was people oriented, promoted a good work/life balance, had great benefits, and offered career advancement. Like every company, management at the top was often more concerned with their own advancement but lower level managers always seemed to want to see you be successful. The best part of the job was the respect that comes from working for a leader in their industry.

Supportive and patient team!
Mentors and managers were very helpful and supportive to me as the only intern on their team. It was my first time working in this industry but my uppers made sure I was prepared for what I needed to do!

Great company and coworkers
The culture was amazing, and the people who work at VMware are beyond amazing. Glad I was able to be part of this amazing company. Highly recommended.

Great company -- highly recommend it
My contract was short (filling in for someone one leave). I enjoyed working there. My manager and co-workers were helpful and friendly, and from what I could see, VMware strives to provided a good work/life balance for its employees. My only criticisms are that the on-boarding process was bumpy (sent the wrong computer and a bad power supply which they replaced with one that was incompatible) and they didn't tell me ahead of time about a company-wide holiday (paid for employees but unpaid for contractors) that took place in the second week of my contract. I only found out when I logged in that day. It was especially annoying because I had had a medical appointment for that day but rescheduled it when I got the contract/

Great co-working, excellent work environment, interesting work
IT needs improvement
Great prior to Broadcom
Great company with great pay. The Broadcom acquisition has been very painful and feel like a get rich quick scheme for C-Suite. They have treated employees awful during the process

Productive and fun workplace
VMware's company culture is exceptional. They prioritize innovation and collaboration, fostering an environment where employees are encouraged to think outside the box and share ideas. The emphasis on work-life balance promotes well-being. It's a place where diversity and inclusion are celebrated, ensuring a welcoming atmosphere for all. VMware's commitment to sustainability and community engagement is admirable. Overall, VMware's culture is forward-thinking, employee-centric, and socially responsible, making it a top-notch company to work for.

Good company with good culture
Good company with good culture. The company has great ethics and a lot of good and supportive management. Only drawback is it is not a very much independent company.

Amazing Culture
Hands down best culture and people I have ever worked with. Was amazed at how well people work together even in conflict. It has been amazing to see our depth and breadth of solutions and be engaged with some very talented individuals.

Was a good company
Broadcom acquisition will most likely introduce a lot of changes but overall VMware was a good company to work for. WLB and benefits were great and the compensation was competitive too. Really bright colleagues and a great brand to have on the resume. Leadership didn't really have a great direction in my opinion.

I would not recommend joining this company now though. Broadcom will pivot the focus to on-premise and cut all innovation and growth areas in the company.

Excellent place to work (for now)
Great opportunities for growth and a tremendous focus on employees as well as excellent benefits. Transition to Broadcom will likely change the culture significantly.

Great Culture and Teams
Awesome place to work until the acquisition happened. My 5 years have been rewarding and productive. Worked with some of the best people ever! Will miss it.

Great Culture
Great culture at VMware, leadership is transparent. Benefits are competitive with company wide days off every quarter. There are times where you are very busy and others where it is slower.

Best experience of my career. Unfortunately, I was victim of a large layoff soon after being hired..
What is the best part of working at the company?
Exceptional co-workers and nurturing collaborative environment

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Layoffs and uncertainty about future layoffs

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Support for remote workers was excellent. Easy to use and useful proprietary tools.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Varied widely. Great deal of flexibility. Meetings were generally worthwhile.

Too many layoffs
Don’t feel safe with amount of layoffs plus don’t trust management. How are you going to layoffs thousands of people then repost the same job a few months later? Do better leadership.

Unsatisfactory and I'd have not accepted the opportunity if I knew the full picture in advance
What is the best part of working at the company?
working with very capable colleagues who have a passion for what they do.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
lots of turmoil, resulting from layoffs and inconsistent direction from senior leadership. Also, the company does not truly value diversity, equity and inclusion even though they ""talk"" like they do.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
tumultuous, competitive, inconsistent (e.g., committed to remote work, indicating that 50% would work remotely over the next few years, and then did an ""about-face"" and gave an edict that 3 days in the office is mandatory).

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
very busy with lots of meetings and accountabilities. However, the company did not have adequate technological tools to drive efficiency.


6
Odd culture, vague goals, toxic leadership, but great comp.
Hired during the Reality Labs boom before it was public how many billions they were losing, which led to the layoffs. Performance is graded upon what people think of you and how you obtain friends/allies, vs actual discrete, measurable indicators. Comp is great, but if you like actually getting things done and having ownership of your particular area vs insecure mgmt. , ever changing top-down directives, and constant backstabbing for the PSC evaluation, look elsewhere.

Poor company
What is the best part of working at the company?
Nothing at all don't work for directline

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
No communication with company's HR is very lousy and slow don't get back to you

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
No good management lack of communication no directon

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Hurry Hurry and wait and wait for management decisions

Everything looks wonderful, after working there for a couple of years it is lipstick on a pig
Food, games, youth campus it all looks so nice.

When the reality sets in it is far from it.

1. Leadership is the source of a toxic culture of slew of people working very hard to make lots of money for Meta under the guise of connecting the world. This causes its own set of disillusionment problems once that reality sets it.
2. The HR team is too much in the everyday work experience with a constant bombardment of “justify why you are here messaging and concern” under a guise of making impact. This is something as much of the workforce is very cynical of this pervasive ever-there, ever lingering presence.
3. The company is always changing its focus. Chasing the next big thing, why? See point one. It is not out to fix world issues it serves one purpose. To put ads in people face.
4. Meta does not hire role players. It hires top talent. The result is too many cooks for every thing. The smallest of issues has too many opinions and options because there is not enough role players. This makes working life miserable.
5. There is no commitment to people. There is lots of lip service and they do a good job of selling new hires the idea of “This is your company”, but it is not. It is everything your free mind would tell you before you get hired. It is rouse to make you devote more than you ever should to any company just trying to make a mountain of money.

Good benefits and pay only apply to software engineers.
Company is disorganized, you will burn a ton of energy, trying to figure out what to do, constant scrutiny, high stress, constantly shifting policies
Cutting edge technology
Best environment to constantly be learning.
Vast amount of resources
Exposure to all aspects of software development
Internal sources to learn cutting edge technologies

Technical expertise
Very unprofessional on the HR/Management side of things.
What is the best part of working at the company?
I worked there for 6 months and was laid off due to Covid-19. When I tried to come back they made up a lie and said I fell asleep on the job so they were no longer interested. When I litterally got a check for 2k when they laid us off as did everyone.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Nothing was really stressful. The job was great.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It was very strict and you always had to be on your toes.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Grouping to your team, and working alongside others to complete tasks.

Amazing workplace with very competent coworkers
As a research engineer, your work depends on the specific team you are working with. However, here is a general outline of what a typical day might look like:

You arrive at work and grab a breakfast if needed. Then, you start working. Some days start with a meeting with your team to track the project's progress.

Then, you start working on the issues/todos that you have assigned for yourself. When stuck, you can reach out to one of the seniors researchers working on the same project and ask for help.

By afternoon, you can go meet a few of your friends and have lunch together with some dessert. Once finished, you get back to work and keep working till evening. Then, you leave work and head home to relax, spend time with your family or friends, or pursue your hobbies and interests.

Work Hard, Play Hard
We had a very productive and high bar to aspire to, however we did so with a smile on our face, jokes and playful banter were daily occurrences. I was included in last round of layoffs, even though last two perf cycles were Exceeds Expectations. I worked their 9 years and grateful for the friends and experience.

I imagine this is what the end of the workd feels like. Vacuum of kindness and respect
What is the best part of working at the company?
A ship without leadership or a captain. Completely listless and without regard for people or direction.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Its failure to provide work. Failure to perform. Constant layoffs and lack of leadership accountability.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Stressful. Inauthentic. Frat boy worship of the CEO. Hunger Games atmosphere

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Scrounging for work. Countless rescheduled meetings. Bobgoals or expectations

All support I needed
I really liked working for this company because they were very kind, they are wonderful people, they provide excellent service, they pay fairly and on time, and they give many incentives.

Ambiente muy rápido y orgnico
Esta empresa es una empresa gigante pero que sigue operando como una start Up. En momentos todo parece un caos pero de alguna manera los problemas son resueltos.

I love matter, I appreciate how long her CEO has been driving
I love working at Meta. I am empowered to create my own work life, balance, and drive my own career forward. The ball is completely in my court. If anything is falling short, all I have to do is work with my manager on how to fix it. The only thing I don’t like right now is the uncertainty of layoffs constantly in the air. if layoffs could ever subside, I would love to get back to living the work in the company again.

Fully remote work, encouraged, management is excellent, it’s easy to get promoted and move up, tons of opportunity for advancement, rewarding work
Layoffs create uncertainty and cause stress for teams, making it difficult to navigate relationships and team dynamics right now.
4 stars
What is the best part of working at the company?
Work life balance, perks and metaverse projects.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
High standard - pressure to meet deadlines & numbers!

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Amazing. Come and accepted as is

Great compensation and benefits, maybe sunsetting
Still great, but not what it used to be. Demoralizing with all the negative press. Good people, good benefits. Best health insurance and benefits are consolidated using a great portal. Job advancement is necessary until IC5

Great health insurance
Highly bureaucratic
Not bad, but do feel pressure
Overall it is not bad. A lot of smart coworkers. However, it is true about the psc driven culture . Which made things weird. People have to chase after ""impact"" .

productive but need to be more customer focused
Developers were highly productive but need to be more customer focused (documentation and software support. Software developers was highly skilled in their role. They need to understand the total impact of software from a user perspective.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Morning huddle then daily activities and end of day meetings

Good
I think that working here is fine. No complaints after my short time there. Had a good manager. Typical large public company with lots of staff and employees.

Good WLB, stingy on raises
Can't complain too much, work is good, tech stack is a bit dated, and you're generally free to handle your business during the day if you have something to do. But don't expect yearly base raises so you can fall quickly below market.

Good WLB, average work, bad management
Pros

good place to learn, access to learning materials including business and technical from Oracle and 3rd parties: books, classes, courses, etc. Flexible to work from home, office or mix. Regional roles provides access to be exposed to different countries and cultures.

Cons

HR processes for Talent evaluation and appraisals are not effective, salary increase and promotions are on freeze since ever, and happens on exceptional basis, to get increase or promotion you are encouraged by management to bring offer from another company.

Advice to Management

if you want to retain talents you have to proactively find the talented people, embrace them, and make sure they stay. HR function should not be limited to payroll and absence.

easy people to work with
Meetings and tasks were very straight forward and people were nice enough to help you out. I am grateful for being able to work at oracle for the time being

Great people
I had a great experience working on Oracle Retail; great people, good culture. Too many changes in middle management required to prove your knowledge to a new manager constantly.

Good benefits but stressful
I have worked in consulting, development, and support. Consulting was the least stressful and (dare I say) fun. Development had some stress but it was offset by enjoyment of the work. Support is extremely stressful with a complete overload of work. This area is severely understaffed.

Great people
The company has great people! Very caring individuals and I met some wonderful friends while working there. A lot of people there are very understanding.

Oracle is mature company and growing is steady
Fun place and work life balance is great

Oracle is pure software product company so work in oracle (software provider) is little different than working at consumer.

Diversity
Pay
Oracle is a good place to work, but you have know what you want from it.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Oracle provides a lot opportunity to train and expand skill set, They offer the tools.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Lack of leadership and guidance to use the tools they provide. The tools are there but it remains unclear to an employee which focus areas are really needed by the companies strategy. You can go down a learning path you pick with encouragement from day to day manager, but then that path is not valued with the strategy and future work, but yet it offered and you are encouraged to pursue it. Seems like a disconnect some where.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Typical cubicle layout. low wall cubicles. Teams try to sit together to enhance collaboration. often time it can be distracting with the background talking while trying to focus on applications or own conversations in person or on the phone.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Facility support and mailroom support. Was my role. Receive and deliver packages from couriers such as FedEx, UPS, and US Postal. Deliver to staff. Assist with building maintenance issues.

Little-to-no upward mobility, no raises, no future prospects
I joined Oracle as part of an acquisition. The previous company was great, with yearly raises and plenty of opportunities for growth. Once Oracle came in, there was a raise and promotion freeze with no end in sight, little to no communication between Oracle leadership and my direct leadership, and just overall appearances of the new company not caring at all for the old company’s employees. Its unconfirmed, but I suspect they are working towards outsourcing the department I was in entirely.

Bad
Don't think about employees mental well being or work/life balance. Don't put in place correct systems or training to learn and develop tools that are critical to your job.

Oracle Review
So far the experience has been all that was expected. Pay could be better. What could improve are growth opportunities. The experience is pretty much what you make it

Great WLB!
Great work life balance and very interesting work on the cloud apps. Would love to work here some time in the future again. Was in both sales and marketing roles.

Mass lay-offs make it hard to trust this company
I worked for Oracle for just over a year before I was abruptly laid off with no prior notice. I was assured the lay off was not performance-based (it seemed to be part of a massive line of lay-offs Oracle participated in in 2022). Unfortunately, this company is like the rest of the big tech giants; they hire too many staff members, obsess over metrics and targets, and aren't afraid to trim the workforce to meet their goals. Other than this, it is a perfectly acceptable company to work for.

2/10 wouldn't recommend
Great place to start but I would not recommend staying and growing within this company. Gain the experience and leave within 1 or 2 years. You might get laid off before then anyway.

productive work and fun place
There are some people who have different perspectives of working and that is to earn money. People make money to improve their reputation. People want to be liked and respect by earning some money so their community can accept them and respect them. Sometimes working for satisfaction is not enough for daily life, to pay the bills and rent people have to earn enough money to fulfill their basic needs even though if it’s not satisfying. To reach that dreams which make people work for money and they can have their future relaxing and seeing their children’s well-educated and happy. Earning money becomes so much important to survive in this expensive world that least people care about the spiritual satisfaction of work. People should celebrate what they have, and they will feel less irritated when others celebrate and enjoy what they


Good place
Just needs to be paid more since new hires are making 3-5 more an hour. Started at 27 and hour. New hires off the bat are making over 30 an hour. Oracle stated there will be no more raises for this year or the next…

Great Company
Oracle has solid leadership teams, and they care about their people. They support their employees both in their professional and personal lives lives, and promote career growth.

Great people, no raises
Great place to start. Disorganization, but much to learn. Culture is iffy w/ layoffs in many sectors. Remote options. No room for raises in the next year despite profit.

Good work life balance
Work life balance is really great. The compensation can be better but the other benefits are good (i.e. 401K match, health, dental, life insurance, annual bonus, company stocks etc.)

No Room for Growth
Overall ability to work from home and pay was great. Benefits and leave excellent. However, no room to grow professionally. Very bureaucratic, difficult to implement change.

Work was easy
No complaints one of the easiest jobs I’ve ever had. The management was not the best, a lot of selfish mindsets. If you keep your head down and do your work life is good.

Overly Rigid Structure, Can be Successful if You Try
I came to Cognizant from a small company they acquired. Their processes are very different and it has been a challenge to marry the two. There has also been a lot of leadership turnover in the last few years, so what is required of your role and the requests from leadership seem to change constantly. You can be successful if you work to understand the overall structure and needs of the company, but it can be frustrating if you are not used to working for such a large organization.

That said, if you can find a job that you enjoy and are ok with dealing with the large company politics, then it's a fine place to work. If you prefer a more ""boutique"" or ""agency"" work environment, you won't be happy at Cognizant.

Local management is good but the national management goals do not line up
What is the best part of working at the company?
The inclusive benefits package was good

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
They pressure for a high work output while not wanting to compensate with a matching wage

Good place to work with good compensation
Good place to work with good compensation . Lot of opportunities to grow based upon associates strengths. Good place to learn new technologies and work with great industry leaders.

Lot of opportunities
Looking of opportunities and platform to grow. Getting into right project helps you grow. Good onsite opportunities also if you stick to a project and perform well.

I learned a lot, but in hindsight, the stress took a tremendous toll on my wellbeing and it wasn’t worth it.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Many of the people I worked with were great.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Leadership lack of respect for more JR associates, misogyny, favoritism.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It wasn’t great. The leaders in the verticals I supported were incredibly dishonest to prospects, clients and staff.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Long, unpredictable & often projects landing in my lap at the last minute with impossible deadlines.

Productive and Fun work environment
I have worked with Cognizant for just 4 months on their project-based account. Overall the experience was good except when salary week was coming. Every salary has a dispute. Even though the Company is top-notch, HR and Finance sucks.

Cognizant offers the highest base pay in the industry and they don't have a ceiling for it. They also have profit sharing twice a year and their salary increase yearly is amazing.

I think Cognizant need to take a look at their HR and Finance department. Those departments will leave a bad mark on the company,

Your last pay will take 2 months - which is absurd and when you reach out to their HR or Finance department they don't reply to your emails. Once they do, they will reply with a typical AI reply.

Free Lunch, Overtime hourly pay
HR doesn't reply to your emails unless you call them out
Having this company on your resume will hurt you!
Add cognizant innovation and a streamlined work environment is not fostered. There is persistent misaligned resources in an inability to deliver effectively to his clients. I do not recommend working for this company at all.

Collaborative, really young , miss you! Managed was 25

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Busy, free lunches at FB were the best part of the day

Best fun place
Great and lovely place to work and enjoyed the culture here and got a support and encouragement from management. Worked in different regions and various clients but able to recognise it well

Good company for beginners
Good company for starting career. They will train you well and
Put you in projects


Good work culture, but a lot depends on your boss.



Productive and Fun working for different clients
Sometimes On site off shore shake hand calls are at late night. Otherwise its good if you get good pay, company offers health benifits and 401k benifits.

Great place to work
Provides a great working environment, and opportunities to learn and grow. Pursue career aspirations. Wide range of technology and business domains to work for.

Great Benefits - A Lot of Churn from the Merger
When Warner Brothers and Discovery merged, there was a lot of churn from combining two organizations into one. I was eventually caught up in the layoffs in September of 2023. Overall, it was a good place to work. The real negative to me was that senior leadership didn't seem to trust the people under them - the deployment process for public-facing apps was extremely rigid, complicated, and siloed.

Stressful, long hours, toxic culture
There was a constant shift in management and lots of politics and a toxic work environment. I wouldn’t recommend it. It was normal to work 12-14 hour days and never receive appreciation for it. More was always expected within impossible deadlines. High pressure, low reward.

Good salary, but very political
It was like being in high school all over again. If you were not part of the original Discovery click, you were not appreciated and your voice was not heard.

Great place to work!
By far one of the best jobs I've ever had! The culture has changed a lot since the merger, but overall a great place to work. Loved my clients as well.

Good company with great talent
The people and culture at WBD are what make the company a great place to work. The business has experienced many significant disruptions in the past few years due to mergers, so there are some challenges but hopefully those are diminishing as integration continues.

Post-Merger Downfall
Toxic work environment, low pay, and constant layoffs. It used to be a fun company to work for but went downhill after the merger. Huge lack of communication across departments and unclear direction from leadership.

okay
Harry potter New York associate- the store can be chaotic from high foot traffic, and it is mainly tourists which can get stressful. High turnover rate at store, with constant changes of associate rules, leadership structure, store construction. Over all, it’s clearly very new and they have a lot of kinks to work out. The pay and benefits were great , which made it some-what worth it.

Discovery erased all brand uniqueness and identity.
Turner and WarnerMedia were a blast to work for. There was an air of excitement and my leadership always made best efforts to accommodate their employees.

Enter Discovery:
Mindless enforced mandates with complete disregard for how it impacts the brands or employees. The place has been gutted and flagship brands have been forced into the background.

E-level leadership is tone-deaf to the issues facing their employees. This once fun work environment is now somber and quiet while successes legacy employees achieved are now claimed by Discovery as their own. There is a brain-drain occuring with no signs of stopping while the bottom line is now all leadership talks about.

All talk about diversity and inclusion is just for show. They exclude employees who don't agree with the Discovery echo-chamber and vehemently gas-light anyone brave enough to speak up. Everyone is miserable except the execs who act like they are the best thing to ever happen to the company when it's the exact opposite.

Reason and logic are gone and a leadership who works to serve their employees is a laughable notion at the top.

Don't work here if you want a pleasant work environment. It's turning into a sweat-shop under our CEO.

Used to be fun.
Agonizing drone creating mentality that actively dehumanizes their employees.
perfect work balance
Attaining a harmonious work-life equilibrium while enjoying a fair and satisfactory salary, alongside amiable colleagues, contributes to an ideal professional environment. A fulfilling job should provide a platform for personal growth and learning, shaping a positive and enriching journey. Striking the right balance between work and personal life is paramount for overall well-being, allowing individuals to thrive both professionally and personally. It is equally crucial to be compensated adequately for one's efforts, ensuring financial stability and contentment. A conducive work atmosphere with pleasant coworkers fosters collaboration and camaraderie, enhancing job satisfaction and productivity. Moreover, a great job offers ample opportunities for learning and skill development, promoting continuous growth and honing expertise. The combination of these elements creates an optimal work scenario, promoting happiness, growth, and fulfillment in the professional realm.

Great company to workd for!
People are wonderful, the environment is friendly, inspiring, supportive, very ethical.
Organized, business oriented, focused, creative, team style, responsive, attentive, concerned.


Great benefits, healthcare, holidays, vacation, extra time to spend with family
downsizing, office space is relocated too often
Great content, fun work, bad management
The type of work we get to do and be a part of is unparalleled. You will probably never learn more in your career than you will here. But, management and leadership can be toxic with unrealistic asks and deadlines, a lot of micromanagement and corporate posturing.

The merger ruined two good companies
What is the best part of working at the company?
WBD has a plethora of very iconic and fun content to work with.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The merger is an absolute mess. There is no strategy other than generating free cash flow. Many employees say it’s like a game of musical chairs on the Titanic. Amazing people are laid off daily, without vision or clarity into how the business will succeed.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Competitive, watch your back, culture is completely gone.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Budgets slashed, colleagues you depend on have been exited and you have to search for replacements. Some staff sleep at the office to keep up with volume of work.

Very inviting culture, supportive teammates
Was able to communicate my needs and progress often and effectively, had teammates who helped enable me as an individual contributor. Internship was more training than serious work but the broad bases of information security were nonetheless properly covered.

Frequent employee engagement from managers, supervisors, and teammates, plus extremely supportive training material
Was not a guarantee for future positions, which made job search post-internship long and difficult
Overall good experience
After multiple mergers, downsizing and cost cutting measures have increased workloads for most employees and also reduced the quality of benefits. However, the remaining employees are great colleagues and it’s still an enjoyable place to go to work every day.

Productive and fun workplace
Provided ample opportunity to innovate internal programs for inclusion and belonging

Benefits included onsite gym, good healthcare, and on-the-job learning.

Good place to start out
Overall the people are kind and helpful. Management can be a pain. Pay is decent. Great for networking and a good name to have on the resume. Turn overrate is high.

Used to be good
Was good before Discovery. They totally sucked the life out of the company. You live life where they are constantly cutting jobs and cutting budgets.

A lot has changed
After a couple of painful mergers the company I once enjoyed working for was no longer. Very unfortunate that the new CEO main concern is profit and his over inflated paycheck. A very unstable work environment.

Every day is a new adventure
CNN is a large family of journalists who care about what we do and the impact we have as news leaders. Facts first over anything else. Great benefits package, flexible schedules, amazing cafe and even better workers, up-to-date facility. Great pay and vacation time. This is overall the best place in have ever worked. I recommend Warner Bros. Discovery.

Great bonuses
Sometimes have to work holidays
Constant changes/layoffs due to merger
Used to be a fun place to work with great team, remote policy and flexible time-off. A lot have changed since the merger with Discover. RTO policy was enforced.

Good future
Plenty of opportunity for success. Lots of different jobs, anything from semi skilled labor to, literally, rocket scientists. If you have initiative, Boeing can be a long term rewarding career.

Building airplanes is rewarding, challenging, and unique.
Hardest part of the job is just showing up. So many different shops you could be working in and they are all different. Most enjoyable part of the job is you get to build airplanes. If you get excited seeing planes, then working in Everett, Renton, Seattle is where you want to be. Auburn and Puyallup is just making fabrication parts and assemblies.

Union benefits and wages. Multiple skill sets
Politics, management, training
Great place
Great place to work. All holidays off, good raises , and good breaks. One negative was to much politics, if you was not buddy buddy with certain managers then no progression.

Great Benefits
Boeing offers great benefits and in my management role, great work life balance. It can be a slower pace job, but I fill in the down time by training and career development

It ok
Good days then some bad... Not perfect but ok. Some good...Some bad... Also pay is ok not great or excellent but ok...Also some people are knowledgable but not really...Again not perfect but high up ok

It looks really great from the outside; the interior is a portal to Hades.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The medical and dental insurance.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Some supervisors are power-mad human monsters who seem to thrive on the misery of others.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Boeing is back-biting and corrosive. Everyone seems out to get everyone else. Sycophants abound.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Monotonous and pedantic. If you enjoy doing the same thing everyday you might like it.

Awesome benefits
Great pay and benefits. The environment is so dependent on your leadership if if you get a bad leader it’s easy to change jobs within the company. Overall great company to work for.

Great
An outstanding workplace known for its positive atmosphere, encouraging professional development and teamwork, creating a gratifying and enriching work environment.

Good benefits, overtime if you want it.
Had a good experience there, it’s not terribly demanding. You’re able to make a decent income and have weekends off. If you want the weekends they’re usually available. Tooling mechs are the highest paid. Starting rate for a experienced is low in my opinion but it’s a steady, interesting, clean job.

Career job. You may have to move but there are opportunities.
What is the best part of working at the company?
38 years going strong. 30 years in Long Beach. The last 8 in Washington. Looking to finish my career one of these days.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Being laid off with the complications of all products built in Long Beach CA.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
There are many different jobs available. And always different cultures to all the different areas you may work.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
8 hours a day 40 hours a week. And a lot of Overtime if wanted.

Productive and fun workplace
Good benefit and when you get to know the job it’s easy to work every day without any stressful. The company was treat you right with all respectfull attitude.

Great place to work
I really enjoy working at Boeing. The team I am on has great management.

I can flex my hours, am able to work a hybrid schedule (office/home), good benefits, decent pay.

crazy good pay and benefits. lots of opportunity to improve yourself.
Boeing used to be a great place to work. if pay and benefits is all that matters to you then it is still a fantastic place to work management is driving the company into the ground currently. the company has switched from a company that wants to make good high quality aircraft to a company that only cares about how much money they make. quality is down and leadership only blames the employees without actually fixing anything or doing anything about those actually responsible.
union means really good pay and benefits but also means those who don't want to work are protected. Union has been slowly getting rid of most of the good benefits( such as pension) for the last decade or so.

good pay, good benefits
everything else
Great place for family
Very flexible hours with plenty of time off. Work life balance is easily achievable. The work itself as a machinist is very monotonous, your job is to come in and work on the same product line every day.

They try
My coworkers and senior leadership have made it a fun place to work at but there is still areas to improve. Overall, as a site, they still have a lot of growing to do.

Benefits
Wonderful place to work, great benefits, great pay, good work ethic and teamwork. Best job to have a career in. Sets you up for success support and retirement

Well if you get hurt, you will get screwed over. Badly. Overall. It might be fun for awhile, but it's not worth it.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The benefits are the only good thing about boeing

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Working under management that have no experience in what they are managing

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Everyone gets offended by anything. Word on the street (cuz people have been disciplined for saying) gal and boy are offensive words.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Most buildings everyone is micro managed. A lot of new hires act like they know everything and yet have no clue and screw everything up, blame it on everyone else and yet everyone has to redo that persons work… often. At least 2 people per shift screwing stuff up.

Great people
Great place to work and everyone is very cool. Big company so things are slow and pay could be better. Great opportunity for young grads figuring out what they want to do

Great place!
Fun and striving environment. Great to place to work. Great pay and great benefits. If you're looking for a company to start a career , this is the place!

Place sucks coworkers 1 step above prisoners
If you enjoy huffing multiple different solvents and other nasty chemicals this is the place for you. Union mmbership is mandatory. the work can be very dangerous, cramped quarters and opportunities galore to break bones or body parts

Great place
Good company to work for and the management is really good too. They have a union which is comprised of lazy people who want more for doign less. Stay away

Siemens,"





Work life balamce
Siemens is a family friendly company, focuses on maintaining a good work-life balance. Flexible in home office.
Wages are ok but could be better, it depends on department.

Productive Company
Great Company. Good pay and the freedom to be sucessful. Good planning and commitment to growth. It seems like the middle upper management are not necessary.

We have lots of events like Galas and dinners and parties fall festivals
My typical day at work starts at 5:00 a.m. sometimes we get off at 2:30 p.m. and sometimes you have to work over but nothing at Siemens is hard they give you what you need to do your job pays good money the hardest part of my job is getting material and getting up early in the morning and sometimes people don't like to work together I like teamwork

We get Healthy Rewards. Siemens will pay you to stay healthy. Great insurance, 401K plan. We help local schools. They pay college tuition for on the job training.
Being to work at 5:00 a.m. and the point system but we are giving paid vacation and holidays
Good company poor management
I think that the company and the ceo are great but us painters/sandblasters get treated the worst and have very rude/poor managers it was almost miserable working in the paint department but pay was good

Siemens has a caffe
Short breaks for our work
Work till there ain’t no more
Work 10 hour days during the week…8 on Saturday for months just for them to say “we ain’t got no more work” or “we ran out of parts” pay is good but at the end of the day Siemens only cares that they have units “completed”

Management will find a way to make it a toxic environment.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The coworkers were like family.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The job required your best which is fine but the company offered little to zero training. Management are quick to reprimand you.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
When you are left to do your work it's pleasant. It's when management interferes while your trying to do your job.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Start with a meeting then do assigned clean up then continue the rest of the day with your monthly assigned work.

Ok place
Learn a lot but a slow moving company. Not about capturing market share by being a first mover. Good place to work if interested in electrical products

Not the best job
Welding training center is cool they teach you how to weld pretty good and pay you to train. Once on the floor though not great. Management not organized. Mostly just not paid enough for skilled work. If new to welding recommend stay there for year or 2 and learn.

Worst Experience Ever. I wouldn’t wish it on a dog.
The company rewards toxic behavior. The only way to get ahead is to be German. The company is siloed, bureaucratic, and slow at making decisions. Very political and no career advancement. Fake people and backstabbing. Micromanaging culture. Low salaries.

Work Life Balance
Toxic Leadership, Terrible Culture, Worst job I ever had.
I miss my job because I was good at it, even with the unknown work load.
What is the best part of working at the company?
It was a good place to work with many opportunities. I enjoyed my time there but was crushed when the decision to move all manufacturing and assembly operations to Mexico was announced. I learned right then that I cared for Siemens more than Siemens cared for me!!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The fact that I lost my job because operations moved to Mexico!! We as workers didn't do anything wrong, but were cut loose anyway!!!!

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It was professional and educational! Also enlightening and inclusive!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
The typical day was an unknown is shipping. We shipped complex engineered products, so we had an ever changing work load. Some days were chaotic and others were extremely slow.

Productive and fun work place to be
What is the best part of working at the company?
All the perks like every holiday is paid lots of PTO and most of all great people.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The management system is corrupt. Lots of favoritism.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Very diverse a lot of people from all over the world work at Siemens Mobility

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Very fast pace lots of detail and welding a lot

Good learning experience
I was gaining experience which is more valuable to my future career success than any amount of money and credits. Great people around who are willing to help.

Not a very organized place or work.
Bad at communication and very misleading with their hiring process and management was only there for 1month and in charge or interviews and training with no previous experience themselves.

Good company to work for.
Great US management and coworkers, supportive of continuous training, collaborative team environment. German owned so prone bureaucratic red tape and slow decision making.

It’s like working in a soap opera
What is the best part of working at the company?
A lot of gossip and drama. It’s hard to work with people that’s been there for years whispering behind your back talking about you. The gossip goes on all the way up the chain of command.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The supervisor and the managers like to make fun of you

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It’s a very Dramatic place to work

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Like work for the “Days of our Lives”

Worst place to work.
Worst place to work at no organization from dispatch. Every single day you're supposed to have a new work order ticket. Never did I have a day where I didn't have to be blowing up dispatch for another work order. Extremely disorganized. Worst decision to have ever joined this company.

Company vehicle with fuel card.
Long commutes, No assistance, they don't have Technicians because everyone leaves after a year, no lunch breaks.
Low motivation
I felt many people at Siemens were unmotivated. Many of my coworkers were career siemens employees and many seemed content with the boring material. Overall bored as an intern, got payed decently, threw it on the resume, and got out. Pretty inefficient processes everywhere.

Good place to start career
Good work life balance. Learned a good bit while here. Pay could have been better. Limited paths to career advancement in any function without an engineering degree.

Good career experience
Lots of opportunity to grow your career if you don’t mind moving. Management constantly changes. Takes a while to learn how to be an employee of the company. Pay was pretty good, benefits were good as well. Too much input from the corporate overlords about how you should do your job. Though difficult to work there, the experience gained was valuable.

No training and no support
During my first two months of working at Siemens, I was written up for accidentally sending an email with incorrect information during a training period and was told not to go to the person who had trained me for additional training-this happened ONCE, not multiple times and I was written up for it. I had zero support from anyone and during my growth talk with my manager, another colleague was in the office, which I did not find professional, and when I told my manager I felt comfortable in some areas of my work and not as much in others, no support was offered to help when they knew I was struggling. No plan was laid out, no training was offered, nothing. They did not care whatsoever and wrote me up and were cold hearted. Never would I recommend this company to anyone, especially if you are female or a single mother. They are not supportive at all.

Okay place
Nothing extraordinary but also Nothing to be scared of. Coffe machines provided together with mugs do good. Nothing special buy not a great experience
"
Microsoft,"





Good work culture
Company has good work life balance. Was laid off but would work again here. Employee benefits are good and the work culture is really good. Some orgs have complete remote roles too.

Amazing corporate culture
Microsoft is a place where continuous learning is encouraged and embedded in the culture. The company provides ample opportunities for professional development, including access to training resources, certifications, and mentorship programs.

Working at Microsoft offers the opportunity to contribute to projects that have a global impact and a sense of purpose.

Great Pay
Great community of people, Just wish their was more training on products instead of constantly watching videos. Remote work is taking over which leads to a lack of connections with real people other than that all good

Loved working at MSFT
I loved working at MSFT, it had great benefits. How good or bad ones experience is at Microsoft depends on the management team in the organization you work in. But I think in general you'll enjoy working there.

Great leadership with ok mid-management
Good company benefits and culture with excellent senior leadership; however, the compensation is well behind its peers (i.e. Google, Meta). The leadership is well aware of this issue, but has never really addressed it. Therefore, many capable employees tend to leave after 4 years when their sign-on stocks were fully vested.

Great place to work
I’ve been here for a few years. I’ve worked with a lot of great teams and can make impactful work. The work life balance is one of the best benefits.

It was okay
It's a okay job. Nothing to fuss about. Paycheck to paycheck living. Sometimes it's slow. Other days are fast pace. The benefits are regular. The coworkers are neutral.

Fun But Also Hard
Nice environment, great culture, nice facilities. Teams reorged a lot. Good perks, long hours. Lots of opportunities to learn. Some weird politics but overall I liked it there.

Good environment and tech stack
Great tech stack. Good worklife balance, nice perks, talented colleagues. Global company. Lots of room for growth in large scale applications and in a large organization.

Good work life balance. Good Benefits
The company offers above average benefits in comparison to other companies. The work life balance is very good. flexible job and management. Overall, a very healthy environment to work in.

fast paced environment, long hours, little flexibility if you plan on advancing.
Long hours, demanding atmosphere. Competitive environment. Great job for gaining experience. The teams are fun and energetic making the atmosphere fun and fast paced.

room for advancement
healthcare, long hours, demanding. Flexible hours are difficult for this role.
Great job, worth the experience
The Resource Management team at Microsoft for both the Premier side of the business and the Microsoft Consulting Services side of the business was a great experience. It's a great position to learn about how the Services org and the MCS org operates. I felt the compensation was fair.

slowly losing it
Let's be very blunt about something and get straight to the point. Microsoft clearly and overwhelmingly hires and favors individuals from India. Also after working for Microsoft I see why their software and devices are inferior. The organization is very slow at development. They suck at marketing. They had a spectacular run in the past. The salaries are actually low at microsoft and they overwhelmingly hire temps. This is a organization that is gradually losing it. Google and Apple are far far better in every way.

Great place to work at
Love the place. Very female and maternity friendly. Knowledgable people. If you come from a start up, you will be shocked by how much process and overhead you will have to go through to build the tiniest feature. But you’ll get ised to it

Respect, Collaboration, Innovation, and Connection
I am so grateful to work for a company that encourages authenticity, a growth mindset, and collaboration over individual success at the expense of others. I have a manager I trust who trusts their manager which creates a place where I can dig in and work hard , taking risks and exploring new ideas. Microsoft's commitment to Diversity and Inclusion is real. I see it every day in the way I and others are supported in changing the workforce and the climate of daily life!

Amazing experience
I was an Explore Intern at Microsoft on the Redmond, Washington campus. I loved my team, mentors, managers, and hanging out with all of the fellow interns!

Good company, bad culture
Benefits are great but culture has really gone downhill. They don't have a great structure or support system in place for new hires making it hard for new grads to get on projects

Great work culture and get to learn a lot.
Great pay and benefits & perks. Great work culture and get to learn a lot. At times feel lot of work pressure handling multiple projects at the same time.

I enjoyed working at Microsoft. The company culture is respectful for the employees in general. The compensation is good.
I had some flexibility and autonomy with my work schedule. It was really great when my child was small and I had to pick him up from daycare or school. The culture is respectful in general, and there are lots of smart and caring people there. Layoffs are not fun and demoralizing, but I suppose it's part of the game for a big tech like Microsoft. Since it's a huge organization, there are dependencies and bureaucracies. And it's sometimes hard to see the impact of your work.

Good work life balance. Positive culture.
Bureaucracy
Contractor
Contractors are treated as second class. Team culture really depends on business manager.

Great place to work
I enjoyed my time here and think it's a great place to branch out from when working in tech. Great pay and benefits. Overall I would say it was a pleasant experience
"
Chase-2,"




Highly bureaucratic with strong, yet subtle emphasis on sales

I want to make it clear that below is my own opinion and perception of the workplace. I ultimately left for a better offer in another industry.

Chase is a large corporation, so it’s bound to be bureaucratic. Lots of time consuming meetings in person or virtually. They never really seemed genuine, but rather, in my opinion, a way of emphasizing their sales goals. Daily tasks are black and white, no creativity. It’s the type of workplace that gets excited when it’s jean day on Fridays, you know?

Managers claim that their approach is all about customer relationship, but that’s a bit of a reach as some of of their practices would show otherwise. This would be cold calling, sales pitches during simple transactions or account maintenance, pseudo customer obsession. It’s a for-profit corporation, so this is not surprising. I just wish they would be transparent about their practices as opposed to seemingly spewing information with the hopes of having new trainees assimilate quickly.

That being said, I met wonderful and passionate individuals. It was a very diverse background. At the end it wasn’t for me. So that begs the question, how would you know if it’s a good fit?

I am naturally reserved and prefer to work independently with little customer contact. Much less put on an act to genuinely care about the personal lives of customers for the purpose of “building a relationship.” Id rather have organic conversations and relationships.

If you are this type of person, I wouldn’t recommend consumer banking. It’s a solid job otherwise.

Great part-time benefits. 1 week vacation, holiday pay.
Micromanagement, extremely customer “obsessed, ”, training seems more of a formality and not effective.

Great workplace
Very flexible work environment, good management and people to work with, great benefits. I enjoy working there and i’m glad i choice Chase bank over others.

Busy but got support when needed
I learned alot while working at chase, really enjoyed working there. I would still work there if they didn't close the branch I worked at. Management and coworkers worked as team, and I also felt corporate cared about the employees as well. Great benefits good pay. Overall a great experience while it lasted.

Employees feel supported and heard.
Fun workplace but no room for growth
Fun workplace but no room for growth unless you sold products and services. If you are able to sell to customers you will have advancement in the company.

Employees are just a number here
Employees are micromanaged from the moment the day starts till end of shift. Benefits are good but not much else. Management look out for themselves and not their employees. Your bathroom breaks are timed...not kidding. Think of working with a gray cloud over your head all day, thats what it is like working here. Upper management give the impression they care about their employees, but you will find out quickly its just a facade.

Employees are micromanaged
It was a decent place to work..
What is the best part of working at the company?

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?

Not always.

Wonderful
Great coworkers and mangers that showed me how to go above and beyond ! Great pay at the time that I was working there as well as a a lot of paid vacation day

Pay vacation time
None
Busy busy environment
If you like to be busy they have a lot of events they try to bring out people to do a race, dinner, movie nights, and so many more. Each branch does things different but the job needs to get done and they’re really persistent on it! Managers get over whelmed end and beginning of the month in between is more relax bc mortgages, line of credit, car loans are not due but all that is due beginning or end of month + rent so expect lines out the door and a lot of rude customers.

Dinners, free lunch, movies, games, parks
Stressful, rude customers, if the day ends you ain't going home until your duty is complete
Good place to work
I would say that the benefits are worth a lot and starting 20 dollars an hour is worth the stress of what we do. You can always move ahead as well but it is slow

influencing to some moreover I think that my experience was not finished I am still interested in working with the company too.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Rehire able and able to relocate within the company. I love the banking experience of being a teller and the education system behind it.


What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The company going through the name change was stressful because we got laid off with the opportunity to work for the company again.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
The work environment is calm cool and customer service friendly. It doesn't fastidiously rush onto the the next person.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
A typical day is not overwhelming it starts at a good pace with helping the line out at a fast mediocre pace with helping out each individual questions.

Can be a fun place to work sometimes. Other times it’s just a hard day
Virtual banking is just a nice way of saying cold calling. You are calling clients in different states to push more products. Most times the expectations can be unrealistic. 90% of the day you are being hung up on or talked down at by clients.

Nice coworkers, benefits, flexibility
Cold calling, unrealistic expectations
Fun workplace
Great place to work. Is a great entry level job to understand the industry. Great technology which makes it extremely easy to help clients and find a solution

Good
very good place to work
co workers are nice
good career and development
over all good experience
good pay too, wish managers was nicer though that’s okay though

Decent place to get experience
This is a BIG corporation. Prepare for being a number. Job promotion is based on who you know. Same with discipline. If a manager likes you then you have it made no matter what.

Pay
micro-managed, office politics
The only positive is the benefits
No work life balance. You're looking for Monday through Friday? They will schedule your days off Wednesday and Sunday. Shifts are not permanent so they change on a rotation. Time cards are extremely confusing so you will need to ask for help and they look down on it and even coach you if you can't figure it out. Endless cycle of customers calling in about Chase placing a hold on customers money and they will need to visit a branch except most people don't have a Chase bank in their state.

Benefits
Micromanaging and nit picking depending on who your manager is.
Great
What is the best part of working at the company?
The company is willing to pay for licensing their bankers and giving the employees paid time away from the platform in a quiet office space to allow bankers to study 8hrs a day 40hrs a week. They pay you to study and they also cover all study materials and testing fees.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The job itself is not stressful, The Licensing can be a bit stressful because it requires a lot of studying and test taking. But the company alleviates the stress by paying you a fixed paycheck and covering all expenses while you study for about 3 months

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
The company's culture is one where people are very supportive and they take care of their employees.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
for the first 3 months if you're getting licensed you show up to a private office space to study 8hrs a day for licensing. Once you finish licensing they send you to the branch lobby to shadow and train for 2 weeks to get acquainted with the system before you actually start seeing clients.

Amazing work environment
My favorite part of my job is that you can get to connect with people and you can bring a lot of help to the neighborhood. I have learned new skills and knowledge.

Great benefits, employee appreciation, inclusive environment
Short break
Great Company to work for
Chase is a very employee centric place to work and has incredible employee benefits. There seems to be a disconnect between company I initiatives and the pressure that senior leaders put on their teams. Your compensation potential is always changing as a Branch Manager.

Continous learning
Chase is honestly the best job I've ever had.
Very good with career development, has nice transferable skills , and a continuous learning environment

Depending on the manager you have, the management is great and so is the workplace culture.

The only thing I dislike about Chase is the direction the bank tellers are going . Eventually, teller will become bankers which is something I have no interest in. I don't care for the sales aspect of the job , I like helping people the most.

Work/life balance, career development, kaiser healthcare
Non supportive management
Managers play favorites. Not all but most. The favorites can get away with doing nothing all day and the rest of us have to pick up the slack and zero thank you. The favorites get the praise and promotions.
Some locations foster a hostile work environment if one of the favorites feels picked on.

Good benefits
Zero support
Very good
Good place to work and good benefits.
Opportunity for growth and opportunity to learn. It a good place to work. I have nothing else to say. It’s a good place to work and a good environment

Great team of recruiters
I very much enjoyed working with these recruiters. As a junior recruiter everyone was very helpful and friendly, they taught me everything I needed to know to be successful.



1
They are a staffing company so if you are placed with a good company then if can have a good experience, but I imagine the opposite can also be true.
I had a contract that was setup to be as needed. Initially they offered me one hourly rate, but I was able to negotiate about 50% more by making some assumptions of estimated hours to be worked and the value of benefits. I had a good experience with GeoLogics because I worked at a good company.

Productive and fun as your customer allows
GeoLogics is a services company. You're generally hired as a SME on-site with the customer. Compensation and whether you're an employee with benefits or a contractor is in large part determined by the expected length of the position or the contract. I've worked different placements for them both with and without benefits.

GeoLogics management and HR are supportive and responsive if I ask for assistance, hands-off otherwise. But if your customer is dissatisfied because you can't or won't do the work, that's out of their control. I'm an employee and long-term placement. There are no silly annual reviews, goal-setting, or self-assessments. Customer is happy with me. That's all that really matters.

As an employee, PTO is just a bunch of hours you accrue, including Federal Holidays, vacay, and sick. So whatever you accrue and don't use, you can carry over.
Small company. Since ACA, can't afford to subsidize dependent health care. So while your HC cost is low, when I needed to cover wife and kids, it was cheaper to go on the open market.

Executive Leadership that Cares
Had a very rewarding experience with many opportunities for professional growth. Excellent benefits! The executive leadership cares about their people.

Contract placement
My only complaint is lack of benefits. May be common in the contract world. For me 50/50. My other contract company offered health and paid time off; and not very proactive or reassuring in finding/placing my next assignment...but it is COVID era.

Good solid contractor to work for
Working with Geologic as a contractor for General Dynamics was very good, I saw other employee's that were contractors for other agencies constantly get shorted on shift differentials and overtime.
I was happy I did not have to take time out to dispute my paycheck.

They made it easy for me to submit timesheets with jumping though hoops
The initial background check is annoying and they over do it a little
Very Few Benefits!
Geologics doesn't offer any PTO or paid holiday or vacation days, regardless of tenure or merit and the health insurance product they offer contractors is inferior. They did offer 401k retirement savings plan but with no company match. I felt exploited and underappreciated by them and like a second-class citizen working as a contractor at General Dynamics Mission Systems in Scottsdale, AZ.. GDMS shorted me for employee paid sick time and consequentially, I was shorted for EPST by Geologics.

Decent hourly wage
Lack of benefits
Great Place to Work
GeoLogics is a great company, but all the work is government contracting and temporary, so don't expect a permanent full time position. If you don't mind travel and going through a security clearance, it may be for you.

Assigned to work the Quality Management System implementation which was fast paced and challenging
Implementation of the QMS was difficult but we worked as a team. Collaboration with other team members and actual process owners allowed me to develop better communication skils and learn Boeing's processes.

fast-paced, learned Boeing's organizational structure and processes
stress of being a contractor for Boeing and waiting on permanent hire took over a year
Opportunity to work on some of the most advanced technology in the DOD.
By working as a consultant for GEOLOGICS I was able to employ my background in computer technology, project management and USE CASE background to develop the next generation of DOD satellites.

Working on some very advanced technologies.
Pros outweigh all Cons.
Fun place to work
Geologics is a contracting firm, placing highly skilled and talented individuals, embedded within companies. They offer benefits to their employees, based on what each employee needs.

A Good place to work.
GeoLogics has always been good to me. I want to get out of contracting and back into commercial software development. GeoLogics is a contract program management company.

Nice place to work
Nice people. Enjoy working w my co workers. Great teamwork and good leadership. Would highly recommend to others as a nice place to work.

At the Drilling Field Site...
Just about a month working as intern for the company,i get to learn more on fields operation especially on drilling of crude oil, which i never get to see physically. I was with the field supervisors and he showed me most of the necessary thing i need to know...the hardest part of the job is safety measures have to be know and carefully deals with. Most times you must always be on overall coat and helmet and safety gloves and shoes. Lastly my most enjoyable of the job is get to know how to get logs for drilling through map data and working alongside my colleagues.

Free Lunches every day at work...
Healthcare is available for all workers
Employees from the top down are supportive of one another.
Manager easy to reach. CEO genuinely cares about his employees. Human Resource staff quick to answer questions. Co-workers have a special bond for one another.

Free lunches occasionally when holding informative meetings.
No paid holidays.
Great place to work
Great place to work. I have been with this company for many years. This is a contracting position so jobs come and go with funding.

Rude, incapable of reading or basic logic
Thinking I responded to 3am emails too slow, I would be asked to call them to discuss items... via email. Would take 3+ times of clearly worded messages for them to sink in. And of course it's always my fault. Avoid like the plague.

I was the first Geologics employee at Buckley AFB
I did not have day to day interaction with Geologics. I was subcontracted to Northrop Grumman. Geologics management was there if I needed help.

Slow but secure working environment
it's up to what client you get. I am hired as business analyst so it really depends on clients and manager. Be sure to stay positive and optimistic. As long as you put in work, people will see it and they will promote you.

Had a great experience
Lots of learning opportunities and you get to work on large teams with experienced coworkers who really know their stuff. Wonderful people to work with, and honestly TCS is a great place to work at. Work hard, keep learning, and drive your career and you'll do just fine!

Not the company that used to be
Its a great company to start your career should be fortunate to land in a good project. I started when the company was nearing 100K number on head count and today its 600K. You stand unique and have talent, you will succeed working with right people. However, today there is lack of good talent and leadership is not great. TCS is never a pay master, but what to just hang on in any kind of managed services, you can continue to do that. Otherwards, its not that great in terms of how it used to be in the era of CEO Ramadorai.

good company
GOOD COMANY The 3E model of Embrace-Enable-Empower provides an overall approach to step
forward to the new paradigm shift. The new digital age working group holds
power and they need an environment to thrive and succeed. We believe,
together we can leap forward “To the future of Work from Anywhere” with
infinite possibilities and abundant opportunities.

Overall a lot of autonomy, but back end processes need a lot of improvement.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Potential to wok in different industries.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Making sure that you have your project allocation for tracking your time.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Unable to accurately assess this as I work from home.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
A lot of internal and client meetings. Day may start early and end late.

You will get work life balance and help pay for certifications
some days are long
learned new things but some of it feels like starting over college
all depends who you get for management.
i dont see that much of work culture.
the hardest part of the job that it feels like sink or swim.


Could Have Been Perfect
Working remotely for TCS was incredible. I learned about many new technologies, and learned more about technologies that I already had some experience with. These technologies included Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and more.

Management was helpful, knowledgeable, and understanding. The culture was one that highly emphasized career growth and lifelong learning.

The hardest part of the job was actually when I had to resign. My mother became disabled during my TCS training. This meant that I had to begin acting as a caregiver, so I was unable to relocate. Initially, TCS said it was no problem - they would find me a remote role. However, after approximately one month of silence, they asked me to resign.

The most enjoyable part? Quite frankly - everything else. Best job I've ever had. Despite the sour ending, I would highly recommend working for TCS. I would accept a remote role working there in a heartbeat.

Great pay, hefty bonuses, solid benefits, healthcare, dental, vision, knowledgeable management, access to internal/external courses/learning materials/certifications, funding available for certifications
Remote roles not always available
Not good for fresher
This is not place where you will get good compensation and promotion is also not being done on time. People who is in this company since long they are almost not updated with new technologies.

I would advise one should join tcs at last when you want to relax and not do work.

Good place to work.
Good place to work. Some of the tasks can be difficult but good training was providied. I was supported with a good team and in it, a great mentor who helped.

Fun at work
I enjoyed a lot while I was working at TCS.
Choose your project wisely, which will make your career.
If the project is wrong then it it difficult to change it.

Good place to work
Lot of learning opportunities. Pay can be better.
Changing projects can be challenging. Senior promotions are mostly delayed.
Good health insurance benefits overall. 401K match.

rewarding but often political
TCS is one of the largest SI's around. Good working environment but can be political at times. Base pay is decent, pension could be better. Work life balance ok.

Splendid
What is the best part of working at the company?
Good work culture , multiple projects , mobility , visibility , flexibility

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Not as such because n number of opportunities are available it was my longest duration in the organisation because I loved working there a lot

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Good we have good environment , good managers who are supportive they give us opportunities to explore which make us productive and help us in our growth and again I interacted with multiple and supportive HR as well

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
No đây was typical I was given all kind of opportunities to explore and work in different projects of my choice matching my skill set and area for improvesization always

nice experience
workplace culture is bad, my manager checks everyone every minute. Colleagues are friendly and helpful. I used to do in shifts manner, and my health got deteriorated.

Not so good
Likes:
1.You have a lot of free time if you get tagged to an internal project. 2.Job security is there.
3.Several learning resources.

Dislikes:
1. Very bad hikes and appraisal.
2. Very low salary as compared to market standards.
3. Strict 5 days wfo along with strict dress code.
4. HRs do not respond to any of your queries, unless you ask them again and again, they won't even see your message or answer your calls on teams. May revert back if you drop a mail.

They keep you caffinated with coffee.
They wanted the calls under 6 minutes but expected great customer service with the allotted time expected and if a call was transferred, they are asking why and expect the employee to take it in the chin for another departments mistake.
and if the supervisor does not like you, and have remaining working days, you will not get paid for it.
Employees don't leave companies, they leave poor management and bad supervisors.
The supervisors are in other states and not helpful.

good coffee
poor supervisors, if there is a death in the family, you get counted against for leaving"
Booz-Allen-Hamilton,"





Great firm with wonderful colleagues
Booz Allen is a fantastic firm that pays well and treats all team members with respect. Like all management and technology consulting firms, contracts come and go, so turnover is fairly common. Fortunately, Booz Allen has a solid program in place to help those ""at the beach"" find new positions.

ok
started out great and there are a ton of wonderful leaders. However, it's very personality driven, so whichever leader is in ""favor"" at the moment will essentially run the trajectory of the company, and thus, everyone else's career.

No guidance
They do not teach you the ropes, they hope you fail which I never understood as we were all on the same team. Very cut-throat and critical. They had the best food trucks outside the building for lunch,

Great culture
I like working for Booz. Everyone is nice and works together well to help each other. The pay for anything AI, cloud, ML related is good. However, it can be difficult to move around internally.

Great culture & WLB, middling pay
Great company working environment high trust and accountability. Medium pay. Limited opportunity to apply advanced technology or analytical methods. Consider if government work is something you can live with before applying.

Productive and fun workplace.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Good people both as co-workers and bosses.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Contract work is always stressful.

Awesome co-workers and leadership
Love working in the Talent Acquisition department with Booz Allen. Management looks out for staff and is always willing to help. Currently a contractor.

Solid start to Data Science career
Worked in support of govt customer located in Springfield VA. generally good environment and pay plus free udemy courses are a great add. Generally not good to stay too long (>2-3 yrs) if you are going technical route but great place to springboard to other companies.

Post-pandemic work from home Flexibility
I currently have overall a positive experience working for Booz Allen. Just like with any large government contractor -- your experience is highly circumstantial.

Genuinely my favorite place to be
I have been here a short time, but in that time I onboarded, was welcomed onto a new contract, got up to speed, was rocking and rolling, then the contract went to a small business and my role badge flipped. I was so worried about being on the bench and potentially having to find a new job or move somewhere else, but my leadership has been absolutely amazing and they have said they want to keep me around and their actions match that claim. They are involving me with multiple contracts in our area, I am working on proposals and generally being an admin/support for tasks within my expertise window. I can't say enough good things about Booz Allen. I know part of it could be my location, the people assigned here and out leadership, but I truly love coming to work.

growth opportunitiy, responsive leadership, job security, flexible time off
Great place to work
Fun and great for young people. Great first job out of college. Learned a lot. Lots of smart people. Everyone works hard. The benefits were great and you couldn’t beat them.

Well compensated and engaging work
Benefits are so so, and the joy of contracting can be very dependent on the quality of the client and contract deliverables. The pay is good though, work life balance is respected, and BAH invests well in their employees development.

Agile and Profitable Company
Booz Allen Hamilton is a great company with competent leadership and a care for their employees. The benefits are great, the work schedule is competitive but fair.

Great place if you are in the right career field
Booz Allen Hamilton is a great company to work for and they do their best to take care of employees. Obviously as a company they can only do so much, but they truly are a cut above in comparison to most companies. The only issue is you need to be in certain career fields to have great opportunities and room to advance. As a logistician there are not many opportunities and little room to grow. I understand that cyber, IT, engineering, and other similar roles earn companies more money and are more highly regarded and considered more prestigious positions. So if you are in any of those fields this is the company for you. Leadership is all over the board like most companies. I have worked for some leaders that were amazing and truly cared about the people they were responsible for. Others cared more about making themselves look good even at the expense of their subordinates. The other issue is they have a big problem with work life balance. They talk about not working over so many hours due to how the contracts are written, but leadership makes it clear that you will work whatever hours are needed to get the job done.

Pay and Benefits
Expected to work whatever is necessary to meet client needs
Nice workplace
Seems like a good place to work. The interview process was pretty smooth. Still learning about the company as a whole. No complaints so far. I see myself staying for a few years.

Productive and fun firm to be a part of.
Awesome firm to work for.

Management is true and fair.

The learning curve can be steep at times, but overall a wonderful experience with the right team.

The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.

Flexibility
Job security
Average place to work.
Benefits were average; growth and opportunity varies dramatically by management pyramid. Pay varies wildly...ask for what you are worth and be prepared to walk away if you are not valued.

Good Place to work
The Company as a whole takes care of their people, but depending on where you work some of the lead managers/supervisors can be in it for themselves, more focused on climbing the corporate ladder than taking care of there people.

Welcoming, supportive environment
BAH provides lots of training and upskilling opportunities. Everyone is willing to help and offer advice on navigating the company’s culture and consulting.

Excellent Training
My management consulting training has benefitted me for my entire career. Booz Allen provided a lot of resources and training, worked with excellent colleagues. Travel and workload were very heavy.

Probably the best government contractor to work for; average compared to many of the other industries we draw talent from
Most of the firm's business is for USG, so the work can be boring and overly-bureaucratic. Benefits are middle of the road. Very smart people, supportive management.

Cisco-Systems-582836a8,"





The closest you can get to ""Married to a company"" in the US
A Cisco long-timer here. Cisco has defined an era of my life, supporting my lifestyle with great benefits and providing excellent total compensation (stock, bonus, medical and other insurance, 401(k) match and more). I'll always be grateful for that.

Regarding work, I've held multiple roles over the years, and not all of them were equal. The best ones were those with a sense of being on a mission to create the Next Big Thing. Others were more mundane, and some what I'd call pass-through.

People are great and there are plenty of opportunities to spend time with colleagues outside of work, especially on the San Jose campus, but also remotely.

On the cons side, layoffs happen regularly, with big events probably every 2 years on average, in my experience. Also, Cisco does not have PTO increasing with years of service.

Cisco is best place to work in IT sales
Cisco provides a very safe place to work very secure environment. You can never go wrong working at Cisco. Although there have been many more competitors in the market, Cisco still maintains a strong position in most vertical markets. There’s very good work balance here if I had to say one negative thing compared to other IT companies, it would be the performance of the stock over the past 10 to 15 years hasn’t really kept up with what a lot of the competitors have been able to do growing their stock and they Compensation exponentially versus what we can do at Cisco But overall, it’s a great place to work, and we do continue to help our customers and she their business and technical goals

Absoutely the best place to work
Cisco is hands-down the best company I've ever worked for. They put you and your family's mental and physical health before everything. They focus on making their employees happy because happy employees are productive employees. PTO is basically never denied, and you have lots of it. Most people get 20 days of PTO per year, plus another 10 days of Time2Give, which is extra paid time off you can use to voluneer at whatever charity you want. You also get a floating holiday, an extra day you can tack on before or after a Cisco-recognized holiday (all Cisco employees get the eight major national holidays off), and everyone gets their birthday off every year. And if your birthday happens to fall on a weekend or on a day you can't take off, you can take that day any time before or after in a two-week window. Oh, and they also give all employees four or five ""Day For Me"" days off, which are essentially just company-wide mental health days that give you a three-day weekend about once every two months. There's a reason Cisco has been number one on the Forbes Top 100 Best Places to Work list for several years going, and in the top three for like a decade. They also invest in you by paying for training, certifications, etc. I'm going to retire at Cisco, most likely, because no other company I've ever been a part of has been this good to work for.

Learned a great deal and felt like I made a difference, even if it wasn't really acknowledged by some mor 'prominent ' colleagues.
What is the best part of working at the company?
I found Cisco to be fairly easy to work at. It is definitely high tech, smart people!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I found the culture difficult to get used to. Especially as a contractor, felt at best not being heard.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Hard to maneuver and find your 'place' in the company.

You always have something hanging over your head
Due to hiring freezes, we were understaffed. It was strange to hear how the company was doing well financially but the threat of layoffs were always hanging over our heads. In a year and a half, my department had 3 rounds of layoffs so that was always hanging over your head.

great learning experience, benefits, pto
layoffs, work/life balance
Good place to work if you can avoid layoffs
I remember my first day at Cisco. I was super excited to be working in San Jose with some very talented engineers. The first couple years were amazing, I made some great friends and always had an opportunity to learn new technical skills. Unfortunately, San Jose became a major target for layoffs in 2019 with entire buildings on Tasman Dr. being emptied. I beat the layoff system by asking my new manager to allow me to change offices to Atlanta a week before the next round of layoffs. I appreciated the opportunities Cisco provided me and enjoyed working on a very close international team. If you are on the right team it's a great place to work.

Lots of changes
Management kept changing. Good opportunity to learn. Grateful for the various opportunities given to lead initiatives. Had a great team working for me that I think all have done well after Cisco.

Good company to work for
The ELT tries hard to be the best company to work for. However, external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and sales can have a significant impact on morale. There are few bad apples in the leadership change as with any company.

Diverse company with a lot of opportunity
Cisco is large, that's good and bad. The good - opportunity... basic things like getting paid on time and expenses reimbursed are just not a concern (unlike some places!).
The not-so-good: it's large, getting simple things changed can be impossible or absurdly time-consuming. Culture can be hit and miss, everything depends on where int eh org you are, who your team mates and immediate management are.

I wish I still worked there.
What is the best part of working at the company?
The people.

I was a contractor, and always identified myself as such. But I was NEVER treated as such. I had access to anything I needed, directions to anywhere I needed to go and never was given The Shine.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I am not stressed at all. Never was.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It was minimal staff when I was there. Not the best person to ask.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Visit 1 to four buildings a day to trace and inventory analog lines. Everyone I asked for help seemed glad to do so.

Great company
I enjoyed my time at Cisco and made some significant relationships outside of the office. My manager was a pretty good manager overall however the person lacked realistic and achievable goals to disseminate amongst her peers. In the end she lost her whole team.

Wfh
Too many video mandated meetings
Great culture
Amazing work culture, everyone Is very nice and helpful. The company culture allows you to explore other interests than be restricted to just one. Good work life balance

Great teams
There are some really great people at Cisco. I was fortunate to work on a team full of them. My team members showed integrity, creativity, and respect for the customer every single day.



Finance Rotation Program
Great place to intern and learn. If you can be part of a rotational program you won’t regret it. I learned so much that has stuck with me throughout my career.

Great team
Sedona was purchased by cisco- was amazing to work for- I was remote however we always made sure we felt like a team. Communication was excellent. Glad they are succeeding with Cisco!

Outstanding Culture and comradery .
Been at Cisco over 18 years and it's definitely one of the best places to work. The leadership is incredible and the work life balance is great. The compensation is also very fair for those who achieve and exceed plan. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting with customers and helping them achieve their goals through Cisco technologies.

Good place to coast
All around decent culture, pay, and benefits. A great place to be if you have other things in life you want to focus on – great work/life balance. If you’re a go-getter though, things will get stale fast. It also doesn’t help that previously vibrant in-office networking opportunities have not recovered since the pandemic.

Good work culture
Flexible with remote work and good culture around work life balance. Pay is a bit low for tech but benefits are good. Not transparent about promotion structure.

Cancel culture is alive and well here
Management can be unprofessional.
Management is unethical, and will intentionally lie to you and play major head games. They also keep two sets of books, one for them and one for the client. They are clueless and play the cancel culture games. Run from this place.

None, run away from this place

Mostly great
The people are great, the job is good and can be challenging. Sometimes you work on things you don’t care about or know anything about but that’s just life in general. The only real issue is that there isn’t a lot of training, how do we do paperwork properly? What part of the code base does what? Things like that should probably be taught early on.

I love middle management they are very helpful and knowledgeable about everything. Upper management is hard to get a read on because you don’t really talk to them much. Unlimited pto as long as it is approved is pretty nice.

FTO rather than PTO, good management, good coworkers
Little to no training
Negative. Not a good company to grow.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Not a good place to build career. Spent 12 years here. Got nowhere.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
no career growth, no training opportunities.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
there is no culture. basically a body shop interested in making money.

Productive, and fun to work there..
What is the best part of working at the company?
security, benefits and pay as well

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
the position which requires. It has nothing to do with CACI.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
very professional and helpful for any needs

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
busy, progress and achievement.

CACI is Managed by Children (at all levels)
Senior-level management is run by children with zero insight or concern about what is happening at the account level. You raise up concerns and ways to fix problems and they are ignored. The customer is frustrated that program-level accounting is a challenge for CACI and senior-level managers do nothing to fix the problem. Program managers are also clueless about what is going on with the customer. All they do is say yes instead of trying to determine what the customer wants or needs. Task order leads are junior-level resources who have no idea how to develop and manage a task order bus/tech strategy to deliver for the customer. I'm so glad I moved on after 5 years of dealing with CACI nonsense. The new company actually has a clue and it was a real eye-opener to see how well they managed customer challenges to successfully deliver for the customer.

Pay was decent but management is awful.
Senior mgmt. does not care.
It was a very productive and professional work environment where skills and talent were recognized.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Great management support and overall benefits plan, including 401K and stock option contributions.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
No stress. Arrival time at the work site was reasonably flexible as long as 8 hours a day were put in so that right there alleviated traffic induced stress and made for a more productive work day.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
The location I worked at the the job I performed was relaxed, yet professional. Mission-oriented productivity was first and foremost, but the pace of production was reasonable and everyone got along fabulously.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
I show up, get situated, check email and message traffic, check in with colleagues, and get to work.

Doesn't pay the best, but doesn't demand too much either.
CACI has something of a reputation for having relatively low salaries, but the quiet part is that not a tremendous amount of work is asked of each individual employee. The best workers DO rise, and the coasters coast, content with what they make. If you're willing to do the minimum of your expected roll, then you can expect sufficient compensation. Just don't expect a direct correlation between going above-and-beyond, and getting a soaring promotion track. Sometimes you just get saddled with extra work.

Flexible hours are an option, and time off is very easy to manage.
The deployment arrangements are chaotic and the compensation is lackluster.
Detailed and required.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Flexibility to different types of jobs.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Employees not getting supervisory support on a regular.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
The work environment is multiple tasks and online training. The culture is high tech, customer service, Help Desk and technical support.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Receiving a spreadsheet with request to create Certificate Registration Instructions, answering inquiries and responding to emails.

Missed Opportunities. So much opportunity tj be a decent place but overrun by pill popping , edible minds .
What is the best part of working at the company?
Lots of resources, opportunities to work at different locations , but nearly impossible to land the job unless you know someone .

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Watching toxic people get away with everything . The toxic people didn’t appreciate CACI but were able to scare the decent people away. Offsite managers and HR lies and listens to the squeaky wheels vs reality .

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Toxic , to many layers, too big. Too many young people who think they are right and don’t want to learn from older people with experience.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Anti social environment, Asking someone abojt their day was offensive . I’m think the business unit I was at was trash.

A very good company to work for.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Excellent management that believes in team building and leadership skills.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Most tasks are time sensitive and require more effort.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Management has an open door policy which allows for an easy communication.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Working long hours and enjoying my day.

CACI is a company that wants their employees to advance and focus on customer satisfaction.
What is the best part of working at the company?
There is always room to grow and if you work hard, your efforts are noticed and most times rewarded.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I worked for a government customer so they were demanding. But the team aspect in 5he company definitely helped to alleviate said stress.


What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Uplifting, positive, work hard/play hard. I was surrounded by a lot of military veterans so everyone was down to earth.

Great place to work and management was excellent
What is the best part of working at the company?
They treat their employees respect and make you feel valued.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I had very little stress worth mentioning

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?"
L3harris,"





If I were to sum it up in one sentence, this would be that sentence.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Being a part of world changing innovation.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Having tens of thousands of customers all over the world. Some limit to functionality due to security.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Very professional. Quite well structured.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
The environment allows for you to work on the work that you were hired to complete. There isn't a lot of micro managing.

Nice for hours, Bad for health
I have been with the company for 2 years (luckily about to leave). As mentioned its not bad to build hours 40 to 80 flight hours a month. But your schedule most of the time will not make sense and will work your but off for a miserable pay, management are all snakes, they want the world and give you nothing. Nice example: always was helping management with trouble students and extra lessons, never got a minimal kind of help back. So if you decide to work here good luck, things have changed a lot this last 2 years but not for the best.

Minimal area for internal advancement
Unless you get training outside of the company, you are very unlikely to make any sort of personal progression. That and even if you actively talk to upper management, you’re not likely to get anything unless you're friends with somebody in that area.

I would never work there again.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Benefits (sort of). There’s “unlimited PTO”. If you have a manager that allows it, you can get up to 200 hours. Most managers only allow 160 hours. It’s all “discretion” so you don’t really own or are entitled to your PTO

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The management at Wilmington MA. I would never work at that site again. Inefficient and raising concerns will fall on deaf ears. HR is basically useless

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Toxic. That’s the summary of the Wilmington MA site.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
No one day looks the same, but it probably looks nothing like the tasks you were hired to do.

Very good
What is the best part of working at the company?
Friendly atmosphere and people are very supportive

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Too many layers of management ..change is difficult

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Friendly and cohesive .. depending on which plant you are .. each one has a different culture

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Help others use data to make decisions

Exciting projects, poor management
Poor performers are not penalized and have no incentive to improve. Contracts are often delayed or cancelled before the product is finished. Work is often hard to find and work on overhead projects is borderline demeaning.

Old Boys Club
(Well this is from a number of years ago...so don't know if things have changed or not since then?)

Typical old boys club in much of top-down middle management who show lots of unfair favoritism to their buddies, while scapegoating others. Probably only 10% of managers were technically proficient like player-coaches. The rest just played office politics and shared social circles.

Their buck gets passed to engineers, who are to take ownership of, yet given no power in defining, their projects, lol. Perpetual understaffing and overtime became the norm and work/life balance was a joke. Although at least you do get paid for OT. But, there was a middle-aged guy who lived at the office suffering a major health crisis or death every few months. They just chalk that up to downsizing, I guess...

But all in all, probably not that different than most legacy corporations today, to be fair?

It’s alright
The days I spent waiting to work here versus the days I worked definitely didn’t correlate well. They offered me the job and then gave it to someone else which left me without a means to pay for my bills and they didn’t care. I explained what I was going through and yet instead of working with me they let me go. Also some of the workers are snakes so always watch your back in this company.

Good pay
Management HR co-workers
A must for someone looking for growth and for someone that wants to be part of something great!
What is the best part of working at the company?
Lots room for growth and opportunities.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Nothing, is a well established company with clear procedures and rules to follow

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Awesome, inclusive and very understanding of all different cultures.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Start at 730 finish at 430 every other Friday off. 9/80 schedule

Great products, poor leadership with few morals
What is the best part of working at the company?
Great technology and end products

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Extremely poor follow through on discrimination complaints. All follow-up was directed at the employee about what the employee did to bring about the discrimination and harassment from a senior leader. Leadership did everything to push the employee out and bury the complaint against its leadership.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
No planning or tools required to successfully perform the job at hand. Employees constantly put in ""no win"" situations then criticized for not meeting them.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
10 to 12 hours, no comradery, over 50% turnover in Supply Chain functional areas

Overall, I would have to give it a pluses over minuses review. These days, it is tough to find that happily ever after for Engineers
What is the best part of working at the company?
Flexibility for working hours as long as you get good work accomplished and help to move the business forward. L3 Harris has good people at the worker bee level and that makes it worth it.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Managerial pressure to perform is such that any period where there is a lack of work on your plate, where IDL (Indirect Labor- overhead) is charged, gives you the impression that you might be canned at the next business down-turn.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
In general, good. Again, the working people mostly are good but the managerial level and the constant emphasis on positive c ash flow is stressful.

Better once permanent
Becomes much better work environment once you become a permanent employee. As long as you can make it through the initial temporary employee position.

The good hybrid schedule and lots of help but you have to ask for it.
Culture is very dry. You probably won’t make any friends here. The pay and pto is better than most companies. There aren’t too many incentives like pharmaceutical industry. It’s a good stepping stone but most people leave after a few years.

Work/life balance
No bonus, no perks, boring atmosphere
A great place to grow a young career
Plan on 50+ hour workweeks. 60 is appreciated. PTO is ""unlimited"" but you'll never take all 160 hrs and you don't get paid for unused. ""Off"" fridays mean you get to work from home. Lots of talented, dedicated folks - just be prepared to dedicate yourself and work the long hours. Some positions have paid overtime, so there's money to be made. Defense contracting takes some getting used to if you're from the private sector. Little incentive for efficiency. Lots of very rigid, defined processes. Can feel like it's impossible to get things done. LOTS of turnover means there's opportunity for advancement, and also stress and inefficiency. Very conformist environment. Great parental leave policy, but 60 hr weeks don't allow much time with the baby after that.

Money, talented co-workers
60 hr work weeks
Satisfaction Depends on Factors
Very cliquey. Lots of turnover happens. Satisfaction depends on what group you are in. It also depends on what projects you are assigned. In my case, my management stays off my case. However, I don’t get assigned the more “interesting” projects. I was on a horrible project for a very long time.

So much fun
Working at L3 has been an adrenaline rush of innovation. I’m constantly inspired by the exciting work we do. Every day brings interesting new challenges, problems, and exciting opportunities. It’s the best.

work there only if you dodn't care for your career and pay
Bad culture and non-appreciative leadership.
Very hard to recognize people even for small things.
Work-life balance is okay though.
9/80 schedule which gives you every other Friday off
Variable compensation (annual bonus) is reserved only for higher grades

Challenging the status quo
The company challenges the status quo, and I love every moment of it. The dynamic environment keeps me engaged and excited. I liked working in non-traditional environments, with interesting tech and creative people.

Unleashing creativity
Working here encourages creativity and innovation, making it an exciting playground for turning ideas into reality. I really enjoyed my time here and highly recommend it.

Amazing team spirit
The team spirit here is contagious. We collaborate on exciting projects that make each day an exhilarating experience. I really like my coworkers and enjoy spending time with them every day.

Thriving on innovation
This is a hub of innovation where every day brings exciting challenges and opportunities for growth. It’s invigorating! I wouldn’t want to work anywhere else.

Lockheed-Martin,"





We move towards a constantly changing goal of how to do better, both personally and professionally. A safety oriented environment.
Difficult company to get into, but easily the best job I've ever had. There are some clear downsides, but the positives make up for it dramatically. Excellent place to work, and highly recommended for people of all backgrounds.

Flexible time and work hours, no clocking in and clocking out with great and supportive management.
There is a culture of telling on people and writing reports on failures, justified or not. Both personally and professionally.
cool
The 4/10 schedule is a compressed work schedule type where employees work four 10-hour shifts instead of five eight-hour days. Although employees are still working a 40-hour week, this schedule differs from the standard workweek of that they only work for four days in every seven-day week period.

I love working at Lockheed Martin.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Respect, from the top down everyone is treated with respect!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Honestly I have no stress in my position. I'm sure other have, but not me.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
I am an out lesbian the culture here is very open and accepting.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
There is no typical day, things just flow. Flex time makes it easy to get the work done.

Wish I could go back , but it’s too far from my home
What is the best part of working at the company?
The shift , the management, the people

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I didn’t experience any stress working for LMCO

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Great people , helpful , respectful ,committed to one’s success

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Clock in , work assigned tasks with no pressure ,produce a quality product

Good but slow
Cumbersome management overhead at times, but good vacation time and other benefits.

A bit lacking in the healthcare department

Good engineers generally, meh management

Great work place
Easy to talk with people. Everyone was willing to help. Does get stuffy and there is a lot of read team. Might get easily bored but you can always do stretch assignments.

good
good place to work and good benefits. coworkers were great and had a great work life balance. 4/10 schedule was nice but working 10 hours seemed long somtimes when busy

Great place to work
Good pay and prospects for advancement. Professional and technical learning opportunities. Travel available for employees that want it. Many locations available

They watch everyone on camera 24/7
They watch your every move and then threaten to suspend your clearance if you don’t turn in their company badge. The worst company I have ever contracted for

Exciting
Learning environment and supportive co workers. My department, had little room for growth. Left due to an amazing opportunity that I could not resist.

OK but no room to grow
The work was not very challenging and the pace was slow. This may have been due to the group that I was in, which was an internal support group. I left after 11 months to find a higher growth opportunity.

Great place to work
What is the best part of working at the company?
Life balance which is key in todays work environment.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Sometimes deadline, however most of the time there was not any stress.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
The environment was always good!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Working with the best folks around

Excellent Company
Great benefits, great pay, great work life balance. 4 day work week is really nice and the opportunity for remote work is there for all applicable positions.

Great place to work
Fast paced work environment with lots of opportunity for growth. Lots of people stay at this company for their entire career and never look back! 10/10.

Fun but slow
Slow work pace, resistant to modern tech at all stages. Essentially boring for an engineer that wants to innovate. Cool to work on spacecraft everyday.

Decent Job with good benefits
lockheed has a nice benefits package and offers competitive pay. however, roles are vastly different. sometimes there are impossible deadlines, and management will sometimes protect their own selves before the employees.

Excellent Work Environment
I greatly enjoyed working for Lockheed Martin, and only left the company because of an opportunity that was presented to me by my current employer. Lockheed, at least at the time, provided excellent benefits, opportunities, and experiences.

Test Engineer
Good company to get your start/foot in the door. Plenty of projects are around to broaden your horizons. Some of the best people I have ever worked with are there

Awesome workplace and even better people!
I've been working here for almost two years and I love it! Everyone is so supportive and they truly want me to succeed. I look forward to going to work here everyday.

Laid-back culture with interesting work
I work in one of the major R&D divisions at LM, and this job provides everything you traditionally want in a job, but not much more. The work is interesting, the office culture is very laid-back and supportive, and the pay is decent. The 4/10-flex schedule is also a godsend. If you're young and looking for adventure, or if you have some deep need to self-actualize and your true passion is not necessarily technical research, this may not be the best long-term choice (though the fantastic schedule also means you'll have time for personal development). However, if you're looking for a good, stable job with interesting work, or if you're deeply passionate about a specific research area, this will be a fantastic job for you.

I hated the job but I loved the pay and two of my teammates. If you're not an engineer or sales rep, you'll never see a finished product.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Pay, Time-Off, Two of my teammates, and the Severance Package.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Working for engineers who don't understand security compliance.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
You'll be working in a cubicle and it's a very structured environment; but don't be surprised about random assignments.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Fore the most part, employees are attending virtual meetings, answering emails, and phone calls.

Humana,"





Great place
Great place to work, great work life balance, some overtime but not a lot. Paid time off is a plus as well. Management is laid back, depending on which department you are working in. just a long drive for me

Great place to work
Generous PTO, love my department, no micromanaging at all. However, there are early retirements being offered to some employees, lots of changes in upper management, including CEO retirement by the end of 2024. Pretty scary times for everyone.

Best job I have ever had
Humana is the best job I have had as a nurse. I am respected as a professional and the work-life balance for me is second to none. Compensation is very fair, and the PTO is exceptional.

Compensation, Pto, work-life balance, work from home, great management support
None that I can think of!

1
Depends on leadership
I had great experiences and terrible ones. It's going to depend entirely on your boss and their style of leadership or attitude. Good ones will provide great opportunity and bad ones will be be awful.

Conservative culture, pays well
Compensation is good, but leadership and culture are formal, hierarchical and conservative. Maternity leave is 6 weeks, which is genuinely shameful and reflects their values.

Great Culture
I worked at Humana and held two different positions first as a direct hire for contract and then a full time role. Humana does care about the employees And provide many perks to encourage a great working environment.

Humana
A typical day at Humana, depending on what position you have, consists of communication with managers and team members. You're also going to communicate with clients and other departments. If you're working with customers you're going to gather information pull up accounts, verify everything, and when you have completed communications with the client you've most likely routed them to the proper location and then you will finish up by documenting everything within the system. There are team meetings and other ways to continue your education and a good method to further your professional experience within the company.

Work from home, ample training, people available to help if needed, good company culture
No humanity with leadership, all stats, negative calls
Not fun. Most undesirable job I’ve had
I worked in health care over 10 years. Why Humana has a retention rate this high is beyond me. I’m not having fun at this job. I can’t
Meet numbers I can’t get answers from my boss. And I never get positive feedback even if I do perfect on something. I always need to do better even if I have a 100% audit. Never feels like enough. I’m a skilled nurse. Shouldn’t feel like that.

Inefficient waste of time
What is the best part of working at the company?
I met some amazing people working here but leadership is clueless

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Constant micro-managing and lack of competent leadership

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Everyone walks around not know really what to or if they’re doing It correctly Dysfunctional

Decent non customer facing position
The majority of this job is researching cases to see whether denied claims can be paid. The management is shockingly bad but the work itself isn't too challenging once you figure out how to do it. You'll be out there on your own for a while.

Productive and fun place to work enjoy everyday
What is the best part of working at the company?
They allow me the freedom to do job and not Mico manage but always management is ready to help me grow and succeed

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I'm a field rep so getting from place to place

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Inclusive and diverse and cares about members and associates

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Office visits meet with key personnel reports, follow up, conference calls, work with offices clinics to resolve patient issues with their Prescriptions , inform offices / clinics on all services and new medication and patient assistance funding

Not safe company anymore
Too much overhead management. 5 overhead rook per 1 developer role, re-org every year - adding more mangers and director but never invest in people who does actual work on ground like software engineer. Everyone want to be manager, never care about staying and dedicate to their work

Horrible
Don’t work there, find a job elsewhere. You are overworked and your schedule can change at any time. Management is a joke & you will be stressed the entire time.

Good company
I recommend working for humana. It is a great company. Good culture. Great environment. Great pay. Can be independent and freedom to find your niche.

Strong inclusive culture though lots of changes
As with many large companies, organizational changes are very regular and that can be unsettling for some. Overall, the culture and engagement is wonderful where the people are people you want to be around.

Ok
It's ok. They have metrics but there's definitely favoritism. Very little chance of promotion regardless of what extra work you put in. Management is very slow to implement changes.

Laid back
Laid back environment. Was employed by the company for over 6 years and had a very cool supervisor. Would have loved to stay on but position was cut so unfortunately didn’t have that option.

Complete autonomy and a lucrative experience with room to make as much as desired.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Complete autonomy and ability to make own schedule.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
When they sunset my program due to COVID.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
I was an independent contractor so I didn’t have a lot of contact with others. I self assigned my cases and relied on my matrix for feedback.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Complete autonomy to see clients at will and provide them with needed care management.

Great
Awesome and fun totally great place to work and I could’ve been any happier and I just really do love it here and you will love it here to. Trust and believe.

Productive, good life work balance
Great coworkers and overall company. Really good benefits and work life balance. Good opportunities to grow within the company. Good benefits and retirement contribution.

Very large and distributed place so experiences can vary based on where you work
Great place to work for me and I've had the opportunity to grow, learn, and build relationships. It can be intimidating and hard to build connections for some people working virtually and not having a supportive leader.

A great company to work for
ServiceNow is a great company to work for. They are on the cutting edge of technology and leading the way in their area with the Now Platform. I recommend working for ServiceNow.

Great place to work
Great place to work. A lot of inclusive spaces to be yourself. Growing technology platform that is becoming a huge player in technology. The work is fun and rewarding but can also call for a few days of long hours. Unlimited PTO is nice.

Great experience with great product
ServiceNow is a titan of the industry, and they treat their employees extremely well. Everyone willing to lean in to help you succeed. Would highly recommend to any sales professional regardless of where they’re at in their career.


1
Incredible culture of teamwork
ServiceNow trusts and empowers teams to drive great outcomes for their customers. They embrace and recognize the collective value of working together.

Great place to work!
A supportive and growth environment is the mantra at ServiceNow.
The compensation is at par with the industry.
They also have Wellbeing days about 6 Fridays in a year that they give for taking a break in addition to holidays and PTO.

Outstanding Culture, Product, and Direction
Workflow based SSCs drive business in a multitude of ways. The leadership team is executing a vision to grow the platform in responsible ways while innovating faster than the market. It's in the sweet spot of being big enough to stay true to it's purpose, without being so big as to chase unattainable areas of tech.

Game changing product and fantastic culture
Easily one of the best SAAS firms to work for in the industry. The product is absolutely adored by nearly all customers although the complicated and ever-changing contracts / pricing can cause some heartache.

Great company - Poor pay raises
After 5 years three years with no pay raise and good performance review. Pay raises and Stock decisions is manager peer based and political. Even though the company is top performing in the industry, pay is sub par. Stock grants started out great 5 years ago but over time Sr leadership stated, the market has changed. Last I checked company had exceeded profits and doing very well. Now the RSU cliff is a strong demotivator. Will be leaving soon as Iam not being paid what I'm worth in the market.

Fast paced, exciting place to work
ServiceNow is a great company to work for. They are on the cutting edge of technology and leading the way in their area with the Now Platform. I recommend working for ServiceNow.


Upskill program extremely lacking
The program was seriously lack luster they sort of just throw you to the wolves with no real guidance and expect you to figure it out because you are an adult. The teachers for the program would often be missing for weeks on end.

To Each Its Own.
Great benefits, and supportive staff, heard many horror stories before applying here but I personally love it. I believe this role is just an acquired taste. lol.


Chaotic
What is the best part of working at the company?
The People on my Team are great

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Management is a TOTAL mess. In a year and a half, I have had 3 managers, and the current one is one of the worst in my career.
There have been 3 Department heads in my year and a half, They are chronically understaffed
The training is SUB PAR.
They have on regular bases 50+ unassigned cases that just sit until they are about to SLA. and I am in one of 7 teams
They never stick with an objective to see if it is working, they take little or no input form the people on the front line


What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
They give lip service to things but It totally depends on the manager to how you are treated, There is little or NO intra-team assistance.
Everything is cliche based on the team you are assigned

Great if you just left your frat! It really is a great product and I think teams outside of sales don't have this kind of environment but the one in Waltham does and I've heard similar tales of the San Diego team.

Good company, very corporate
Good company that cares about its people and culture. Industry leading technology.

Lots of bureaucracy and red tape. Meeting culture where many things that can be resolved with an e-mail result in 30 minute meetings.

Great outlook with some pains
Awesome outlook in the future but have some growing pains. Hard to progress on lower levels. Outdated stack, not agile but waterfall, stacked ranking of employees…

Overall a nice company
Good company, nice benefit, work.life balance can be challenging sometimes. Line managers are good, there are some coomunication issues when it comes down from senior leadeship.

Great Leadership, talented coworkers, bright future.
ServiceNow has been a great company to work for. Managers are well-trained. They trust you to do your job without micromanaged and are there to remove any roadblocks for you and help you grow in your career. Pay and benefits are very competitive. Leadership is transparent and trustworthy.

Awful experience
Aged technical stack, a lot of office politics, awful leadership and no company culture of encouraging inclusiveness and diversity. A company to avoid.

Lots to learn, environment can be stressful
Good pay and benefits and there are a lot of smart people to learn from, but the emphasis on weeding out lower performing employees and getting changes in before blocked days (PD and such) can be stressful.

Heavy Workload
The workload is massive and they are understaffed. Women carry 50 pond bags alone and stock them on a cart. Great place to work if you want a bad back!

It’s a physical job.
If you like to stand 10-12 hours a day. This might be a good job for you. Working for ICQA can be boring but pretty easy job. I’m working for Amazon for little over 6 months and it’s rewarding. You will be recognized for your good work.

Terrible job
If you have any type of mental health issues or u need to take time off they don’t care they will fire you. No type of accommodation for mental awareness they brought me into the office and told me to go home. Worst job I’ve ever worked at

None
It was an ok place to work could use so improvement in some areas.
What is the best part of working at the company?
We was able to work and listen to music while we work.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Some of the people In the environment.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Diverse and different at times.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
I worked nights came and worked my shift.

Great workplace
This is a great company to work for but there are limited opportunities to promote within the safety department. The hours are great, excellent company benefits like healthcare and time off options.

I can Proudly recommend Amazon to anyone looking for a stable job and wants to build career
What is the best part of working at the company?
It was an awesome place to work

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Nothing stressful about working there. Amazon has good wellness for its workers. A beautiful place to build a lifetime career

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
The conducive and encouraging work environment for a beginner. Everything is provided for the comfort of their staff. Most especially the toilets and good dining area to eat during break.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Lovely if I may say. It's a warehouse but you don't have the feeling it's a warehouse. Every shift is interesting

Good money and flexible schedule
Cons; having to hit certain numbers, the amount of standing/ walking is insane, it's a lot more physical than what you think it's going to be. Not much room for advancement unless you surpass your numbers on a daily basis.

Overwhelming quality job
Working as an Amazon Customer Service Associate means you’re gonna be taking calls back to back all day long.. obviously a large percentage of these are mad people (understandable) who want answers and solutions right away, all this while complaining like you’re the company itself. If you have patience for angry people and excel at micromanaging and multi tasking in little time frames, this job won’t be bad.

Work Schedule
Personal time is not respected especially during peak. Employees are expected to work and change schedules at the drop of the hat. What is supposed to be a time with family is spent at the site trying to hit unachievable targets.

I have worked at worse places.
What is the best part of working at the company?
You get days off most the time

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
They just pile more work on you with 0 rewards for doing someone else’s job

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Toxic if you let it and try to have friends at work

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Running around like crazy trying to do everything they want.

Great for a first job and for people going to school
This job is for rough times and not a long time. Management is awful and as long as you keep your rates up for them then you should do well. There is little support with management and it’s kinda expected for you to know how to do your job fully within 3 days. Unless you work upstairs then 3 days may not be enough. It’s best to ask questions and make friends to avoid mistakes. That’s how I kept afloat for 3 years.

Lunch activities, daily food vendors, free t shirts for prime and peak
Poor management and flat rate pay among all department roles
Terrible
Terrible. They treat you like garabage...they don't care about you. They use and abuse you. Have terrible rules and protocols. Don't work in Amazon in pontiac!

None
Everything
Fun place to work, Easy employer to work for.
Slim choices on working schedule. 1st- shift 2nd- shift 3rd- shift, and there's not much of a choice you pick, based on what they need. Clear requirements on job functions, my adaptability to work was only good because Amazon works with its employe's.

Cleanliness
Working with whatever is available. not getting the shift you want at first.
Horrible, only looks good on a resume
My summary says it all, the environment and people are terrible, very long hours, mid-level management are beyond horrible, the compensation lower than competitors, and the company tries to lay you off a the drop of a hat once you're about to collect your RSU's, the average tenure of 1.2 years is a good indication of how bad it is.

Keeps you in shape.
There’s a lot of walking. Some positions are in one area all day others are more mobile. After a month you can start putting pressure to be moved to other positions if you don’t like the starting position.

Free safety shoes
Underpaid
Beware, not a very nice place!
What is the best part of working at the company?
Pay is good. Schedule is good if you like 4 on 3 off.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
You are treated like a criminal everyday!

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Hectic and culture is nonexistent

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Wide open start to finish. Breaks are many hours apart.

Terrible culture and leadership
Money benefits are great...interview process is alot, coaching and training is terrible...culture is extremely problematic, if you are a minority I would advise you to proceed with extremely caution at all times.

Great pay
Terrible leadership, training, goal setting, and unrealistic timetables
No Work Life Balance
No respect for employee's down time. Really need to focus on this and reduce turnover. This could be an amazing place to have a career. However, there is serious disconnect between corporate and operations.

good
good place to work, you have to work very hard and have certain knowledge of how to use the web and electronic devises. you also need some knowledge of how to sell online

Fun workplace meet great people fast paced daily
Fast paced non stop and can become monotonous and boring. If you do pick you can meet some great people, get work in, and get a work out all in the same day. Management always sucked but it may be different now idk. And they did give you lots of snack options to keep up energy at least and food that came in to cook was pretty good

Free stuff sometimes, cool people, work out
Hard laborious days, no time for family"

Assistant to Operation Manager
Good working environment, love the coworkers and the atmosphere in the company. However, works can be a little redundant and boring, but if you know how to keep yourself busy, you can continue to learn on the job.

Everyone sits around and watches movies
Everyone sits around and watches movies and plays on there cell phones throughout their schedule workday. Especially the security guards and security management. One hour breakfast. One hour lunch. Sit around and watch movies all day. RSOC and GSOC do not watch IP addresses and cameras. Then go home. Pathetic waste of alphabet shareholds money.

Watch movies all day and play on cell phones
GSOC and RSOC do not watch IP addresses and cameras
great
great place to work i love it here it is so nice and fun google is the best company on planet earth everyone should work here as soon as possible because it is the best.

Still great company
Opportunities to learn, great perks. Still good culture. A concern is that all the great things are on decline and Google is becoming a regular employer with a fast pace. Still it is a not bad job

great
love this place. I would not want to work anywhere else in the world. Everyone is awesome and I love it. It really does not feel lie work nor doe the people look down upon you.

Awesome people and challenging work
Working for Google was an amazing experience. The work was exciting and managers trusted you to do your job without micromanaging. While company culture might not be the same it was 10 years ago it's still by far the best company I ever worked for. Work life balance was amazing.

Best place for Janitors
They took care of us and made sure we had all the windex we needed to clean the windows. This is not done at most places but they understand here. We love the Google.

Boring
Not the best place to work. I wasn't the happiest it's all smoke and mirrors if you ask me. Nothing makes sense so I just went with the flow until I couldn't.

fun
qwesome place to be it was great i got paid so much money to do nothing all day then i would just use google to do the work when i actually needed to

People and Culture
Great people. Increasingly toxic work environment due to new aggressive hires that don’t embrace collaborative culture. Company was not prepared for rapid growth.

No respect for employees
Worked remote,
Had periodic meeting with two teams and meetings with two cusomers.
Most of the team worked remote.
We support the lcs customer segment for ads

Great
Nothing negative to say. Highly recommend! Great work environment. Be able to work from home is a Hive positive off course. Management is supportive!!

great place to learn
Being a Google engineer is engaging—immersing in innovation, collaboration, and impact. It's not for everyone, but tech enthusiasts find it fulfilling.

Good
Very good. Good pay good hours everything is good I enjoy working with them. I have no complaints to make. Work for them. If you can it is a great company.

all time we need more information abut googol also googol can do compensation
googol have all service for people and can help for research for working you can do with you fried woking learning more abut the information that will bay essay for all working so that can do help all people is most bay fun but we can try all time this googol can help very people

lunches ofr free is that help poeple stert the job
cons is we you try working dose woeking because that is cons
Not bad
Google presents software engineers with challenging projects, high standards, and a culture emphasizing innovation and continuous learning.

Great place to work
Great place to work with great colleagues and support from management. Would never work anywhere else. I love the company and the culture so much that I'd consider living in the office with my family.

Great place to work
As a janitorial worker at Google, my experience was largely positive, marked by a decent work environment that facilitated a sense of efficiency and support. One of the standout aspects of the job was the accessibility of the management team. They were approachable and responsive, always willing to lend an ear to concerns or suggestions, which fostered a collaborative atmosphere. This open-door policy significantly enhanced the working experience, as it made me feel valued and heard.

Another commendable feature was the abundance of resources available. From state-of-the-art cleaning equipment to well-stocked supplies, everything needed to perform the job effectively was at hand. This abundance of resources not only made the work easier but also more enjoyable, as it allowed for a focus on quality and thoroughness.

Overall, working as a janitor at Google was a fulfilling experience, blending a supportive management team with excellent resources, contributing to a productive and positive work environment.

Great place to work
Nice place to work. The company is great and I've learned a lot. They do very well at teaching new hires things and is a great place to land right out of college!

google - High-speed but cutthroat,
""High-speed but cutthroat, the company's intense pace comes at the cost of fairness. A challenging environment, not recommended for a balanced work-life.""







Fun working with
Like it so far, management is well versed results oriented and driven. Cares about their employees well being. Would recommend it to work for but expect delay in results delivery
"
Jacobs,"





It was ok
Department was not as organized as you think it would be for a group working on Nasa projects. They do tend to ask potentials hires for nasa experience which is real specific. The onboarding was good but the training program was lacking.

Flexible fridays
Location. Driving to and from the nasa site from Jacobs
Fun work place
Creating a fun workplace is essential for employee satisfaction, engagement, and productivity. Here are some ideas to make your workplace more enjoyable:

Flexible Work Schedule:
Allow flexibility in work hours or offer remote work options. This can help employees achieve a better work-life balance.

Casual Dress Code:
Consider implementing a casual dress code to help employees feel more comfortable and relaxed.

Office Games and Activities:
Introduce games or activities such as board games, video games, or even a foosball table for short breaks to help employees

Fun job but management ruins that
What is the best part of working at the company?
Was able to obtain my waste water license

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Management does not help or fix issues

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Very offensive and off putting

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Testing samples and making sure the plant is running properly

Great Place to Work
Managers are people pleasers and motivate you to complete projects on time. Work/Life balance is important within the workplace. Great incentives and positive work environment!

Fine
Typical acquisitions company. Extremely corporate and money is the driver. Bought out our company for government contract money then slashed money and benefits then sold us again.

Productive and great workplace
I love working here! You will definitely work long hours, but you will know that from the beginning. Lots of opportunities to work on really cool projects.

No pay No recognition
You are just a number on a spreadsheet. Jacobs loves to string you along with the promises of incentives but then fails to deliver. Advancement is only based on years of service not merit. There is no recognition for going above and beyond.

Very good!
What is the best part of working at the company?
Great employer Always took care of the employee. Good salary and promotions process.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Though not required under sub-contract working agreement there was very little contact with company supervisor. I little more hands on would have been nice.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
I worked off site on a sub-contract.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
I worked off site on a sub contract.

Great place to work before layoffs
Thought I would spend my whole career at Jacobs. Depending on your department, great flexible work with the ability to move career paths without leaving the company

Good Company that changed as upper management retired and moved on.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Large company with a lot of work and fairly good communication.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
During and after Covid, (in which I worked in the field) upper management tried to micro manage from home on my particular job.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Early on was great but working on the road is stressful if you feel as your voice isn’t heard. I was here 16 years and 14 1/2 were good for me. I Would work there again.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Different jobs and different days, construction management while on the road is both tiring but rewarding.

Unnecessary high stress and ulcer causing.
What is the best part of working at the company?
No support from management is provided, you're left to fend for yourself if something goes sideways. Also, their marketing seems very shady and corrupt with expensive gifts being given to government agencies.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Lack of management support and constant pressure to bring in work when that even is not part of your job.

Jacobs management usually has employee games, trivia, etc where an employee may earn a ""prize"" which is usually a gift card varying in amounts.
I enjoy working for Jacobs and I have been a full-time employee for approx. 4 years and even though we are given some type of raise yearly, it just isn't enough to be able to meet the needs of the inflation and rising costs for housing, food and basic needs.

Management is excellent
They seem to only advance the employees they ""favor""
It’s a great company to work for!
What is the best part of working at the company?
They are flexible with the working hours and they give you a lotta technical support and professional assistance.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I didn’t fibd not heavy pressure at all

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Very professional, supportive and ethical

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Staying busy and having work related meetings

Great company and leadership
Jacobs really care about the people and try their best to please all.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Company interactions were professional.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
I don't recall any stressful times

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
I worked on army base, and it was relaxed

But it was a relaxed day.. not a heavy loaded day

Great Company, Very Little Learning Opportunities
I started with the company back in December of 2022. I didn't get the position I wanted, but 5 minutes after my interview they called me back and offered me a lower position to help work my way up. The position came with a nice 10k bonus, school/certification reimbursement, and so-so health insurance.

The only issue is that most offices/jobs are segregated so far apart that you don't really get any opportunity to try and learn anything new beyond your jobs scope. Thus makes it much harder to try and move up with no experience in the field you want to move into.

Solid Company
Good company and culture but going through changes, to include spinning off a large line of business leading to a large amount of uncertainty. Good company for engieers.

Good company to work for
Corporate leadership does not impose too many tasks on you and generally allows you to do your job. The company has good benefits and the contract support team is helpful in answering questions and helping to resolve problems. The upper management team shares information with us regularly. I work with a great team and the work I do supports a customer and a mission that I am passionate about. The hardest part of the job is that staying in place means changing companies as my work is contract-based.

Poor Management
Management is never on your side and though it is a union position the union is no where in sight to help with issues. Enjoyed the work and task I was given but all politics and re-organization gets in the way. They seem they are not too familiar with Operations and Maintenance field.

Good Company
Good company to work for. They take a lot of pride in safety. Careers seem to be stable but there is a slight lack of ability to advance career wise if you are a contractor.

Jacobs is a great company to work for and has a good culture.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Culture, flexible schedule, great pay, and lots of upward mobility

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Not company related but project has infiltration issues which are stressful

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Love our corporate culture. Seems to really care about the individual, especially for a large company

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Typical operations management.

Not Very Good
From the outside looking in, it looks like a great job. Yet working with management onsite, no one really cares about anything besides production. The company really only cares about its stock price and looking good for the client.

Fiserv,"





Good place
Good place when I worked there from 2014 to 2018. They closed the doors during covid and the closest call.center is in Florida. I know some of the employees got the choice to work from home

Toxic work environment
Seemed like a great place to work. Until told the company is moving without warning at hire and changed hybrid to full in office. some workers misbehave and HR n management do nothing to fix it.
Work was ok, but lacked training.

Company does not care about employees
Terrible they false advertising to get employees remote and or hybrid as promoted doesn’t exist for the job they post , it’s about who you want to buddy up with to be successful it not based off actual performance it’s about whose best friend can you be to become promoted, they will mess up you pay and not even acknowledge it unless you bring it up and will try and correct a payroll mistake on their end with no explanation so enjoy HR playing with your livelihood they can care less if you have younger children and they get sick they disinfect as they are suppose to so bring your own and software it’s beyond outdated be prepared for programs and networks to not work and you get points for it too

None
Unhealthy work life balance

3
Ok but no advancement / favoritism
The position I had was ok, easy job, I just wouldn’t recommend if you have a family. Open 24/7 so you typically start out on the later shift with weekends. I feel like personally if you weren’t in the clique you weren’t promoted. Pay was good with the opportunity to get overtime.

Solid
Leadership has old-fashioned mindset but good place to start a career and then leave. A lot of the employees you will work with you will enjoy but the company policies such as mandated 4 days a week in the office bring this place down. They also don't value their tech employees at all.

The most stressful job I have ever had!
What is the best part of working at the company?
That it is a remote position!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Everything this company is strictly about the numbers!

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
System issues all day log ! Horrible training

Decent corporation
In all, not a bad job to work. Pay wasn’t great, but it wasn’t rocket science. Management made your job harder than it really was, but that too was a small obstacle.

Productive and Fun
When they were much smaller scale this was a productive and fun place to work. Close and collaborative team work. However as the company expanded, too many layers of process was implemented that hindered the efficiency and communication between teams.

Extreme mental health hazard
Toxic, demoralizing. People threatening to end their lives all the time. Supervisors that couldn’t supervise a line of ants. Supervisors that would refuse to take an escalation, would hound you for being sick, that requires excessive ot during the pandemic with no support.

Free drinks
No support, incompetent training, toxic management
Productive and fun workplace
overall a great job the managers are nice and understanding. call volume is high but does make time go by fast. Also, they are always having perks like giftcards etc if get a certain percentage on your calls. Sometimes they did micromanage but wasnt the worse.

Meh

No WFH
Micromanaging

Job description are not true
No mental health days like old CEO did
Rude customers

Great!
Good company with work life balance and good salary. Good management with good office. Good salary and managers. Good cafeteria with good food and entertain

Use to be a nice place to work
It use to be a nice place to work. A while before the merger it started to go down hill. The company has lost a lot of skilled and knowledgeable people because of layoffs and attrition. Lots of jobs have been contracted and/or sent overseas. Morale is low with everyone.

Great company
This is a great place to work with competitive pay, perks, cafeteria, and strong sense of community and work culture. Great team and great company with notable acquisitions recently.

Management is all over the place
Some of management doesn’t know how to resolve issues. There seems to always be technical issues arising where their only solution is coming on site even if you’re in a state that doesn’t have an office. Certain managers micromanage you during your entire shift. I suggest working somewhere else.

Sadly American Typical
To work here you have to hope for peers you can connect with or your less likely to learn.

If not they are very siloed, and possessive over their roles and your curiosity to learn and grow.

Productive
I haven't been there as long as some but it's a good working environment with a lot of PTO and benefits. The only downside is that you can be forced to work on your days off if they need you to.

Must be highly committed and resourceful to succeed in this company
Depending on the department you end up working, the only way you will grow in this company is if you commit your time 100% to make sure you deliver your projects on time! If you don't deliver, trust me you will know. Do yourself a favor, if you are not committed to give your 100% to this company, you are better off finding yourself another job. You will see very little of you family at least during your firs year.

Good place to work, they could do better about having spare parts, great insurance and pay, lots of holidays that are optional, long commute to affordable living

Never a feeling of Job Security
From one month to the next degree of job security could change. I know people who were hired for field positions and days before going to work the position was eliminated


Love it
Great company to work for. The culture is great & they promote work life balance. There are so many path ways & the company promotes career growth & new positions.

Good place to intern
Had some great projects I worked and it was very valuable as a resume builder. You learn a lot and it’s fast paced but I never felt overwhelmed. Highly suggest interning there.

Generous Motors
Can make a lot of money if you’re willing to work all of the time. There is never a lack of things to do which can lead to high stress levels. The “it’s on me” attitude usually means “I’m the only one doing it so I have to make sure it gets done.”

New things (issues) to work on everyday.
Lots of dust and dirt all over the plant
Layoffs
Good company - layoffs hit. First job out of college, beginning date was January and then layoffs for AZ department hit in October. Kind of hard to come back from that since early career jobs were already taken.

Love my coworkers and the mid-level management. Senior leadership has unrealistic expectations, causing burn out
My colleagues are great and supportive but everyone is so stressed out and on edge about unreasonable deadlines that don't make sense half the time. Rules that were made to complete a project on time are constantly broken and the pressure to recover flows downstream to the design release engineers. Mid-level management has been great but they are powerless when told to enforce unrealistic goals by the senior leadership team. Burnout is common. There is always an unexpected crisis and since you're already overworked, you cannot get done what you had plans for and fall further behind and then need to waste time in meetings to explain why you're behind in a never ending spiral. Understaffed and overworked.

Emphasis on DEI, good benefits and pay, hybrid, gym on site, cafeteria, fast paced, learned a lot
No time to use any of the amenities due to workload
Easy job but the people who worked there hated their jobs. So, I say miserable.
What is the best part of working at the company?
No weekends and cell phone usage

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The people who worked there hated their jobs.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Loud and lousy. There was no work culture.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Playing on your phone and making scrap.

Great people and decent pay but no work life balance
They have great people and pay is decent however there is not work life balance. You will be working 65 to 70 hours a week so if you value your time away from work, this is not the job for you.

Decent pay, great people
No work life balance, they will work you until you burn out.
They keep lying
The company used to have a great culture, before they lied about making people return to work and lied about layoffs. They do not accommodate those with disabilities and I have personally faced retaliation and my prior manager didn’t get in any trouble for retaliating. A lot has changed and it’s all for the worse.

Productive workplace, great co-workers
Challenging environment, great opportunity to experience a variety of roles. Smart and capable co-workers (leaders and new employees). Opportunities for advanacement.

Great place to work
The best fellow workers, management, pay, and benefits. Its just the auto industry so there is that. Also you feel like you have something to do with the cars you built.

Working together and coming with new ideas to make it easyer
What is the best part of working at the company?
The people and being able to work with other cultures

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
No stressful moment, just need to listen and have understanding

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
A very work together and figure it out together company

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Be on time and ready to work !!

High expectations, lots of politics, challenging, but great learning opportunities and very good pay
Good for learning a lot but have to deal with politics and people who have been there a long time who don’t do much and leave the real work to the newer employees. Overall worth it for the experience and salary, also good bonuses.

Fast paced
Stressful, working 6 days a week takes a toll on you and your family too. Line moves fast as heck. Path to being hired on is a complete joke and honestly could take 4 years or more

About what you would expect
Working at GM is pretty much exactly what you would expect. It is still a little bit siloed, even after the ignition switch situation. However, day to day peers tend to be helpful.

Great place to start my career
I joined General Motors track program and then was able to navigate to data analytics coming from an engineering background. I enjoyed the mobility. Would definitely do it again

A lot of freedom
A lot of freedom, work life balance is good . Management is pretty lenient in my experience. Good benefits and you can use vacation as soon as you get hired.

Fun place
Love to work there. Best job I’ve ever had. Great pay great home time. Just moved to another state. But looking to come back next year. would recommend

Strong Team Relationships
Everyone is a part of the team and respected as a vital part of the success. Most enjoyable part is the people I work with. Work life balance is recognized.

Great work life balance

nice place to work
has a great work-life balance, i've enjoyed my time here so far. Everyone is friendly and my boss is attentive to my requests and not micromanaging. One thing is i think compensation is on the lower end


1
Low pay but high expectation
Petty and conniving manager who liked to micromanage ad nitpicking on time card even with 1-2 hours. Below market pay with no PTO no benefits, yet with expectation to be available 7 days a week and 100% dedication.

None
Toxic management.

Company will fire you for no real reason to hire there friends and family
I got laid off for no reason meanwhile the place was full of all family members and friends. There is no room to grow unless your a kiss up and they like you

Company unprepared for fast growth
Peraton grew from 2,000 to over 20,000 employees in 1-2 years due to acquisitions. They were unprepared for this fast growth. As an employee I was contracted to an IT support role within a government facility. Pay and benefits were lower than that of the company they purchased and below market during the time I was there.

Excellent place to work! Best govt contractor in town
Overall Peraton is a great place to work. I’ve been a Recruiter in this industry for over 20 years and this has been one of my favorite jobs! I support the Annapolis Junction area programs. If you are a recruiter, you know this is one of the most challenging customer spaces to recruit for. We have several large (IT/Engineering) prime contracts with the MD customer. We have plenty of opportunity for growth and advancement for our current employees. If employees want to try something new, they are encouraged and supported in identifying opportunities from within. We’ve been winning a lot of new work (prime contracts), both with the MD customer and other govt agencies. So the opportunities really are endless. Most of the positions you see on our careers page are due to growth. I’m really excited to see what the future holds for us!

Peraton is still a very young even though we have grown quite large in a short period of time. We do care about our employees and we listen. Employees are encouraged to complete surveys throughout the year and the company does take action based on the survey results. This may be one of my favorite things. Is that we do listen. I’ve seen so much change, for the better, firsthand, all as a direct result of the company listening to us.

The benefits are fantastic. And if you have a polygraph the benefits are even better. fully employer paid, with 5 weeks of PTO and many more! We also offer bonus incentives to our employees, even Recruiters!

Honestly, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t truly believe in the company and our culture. I’ve been here 3 years

Excellent benefits, bonus incentives, career opportunities
Young company growing pains, not really a con because the company adapts
Good Work; Lots of Travel; Misleading
It’s a good job if you don’t mind driving. However, due to training being online, you are very unprepared when you go into the field. Also, it’s advertised as flexible. But, you have to work around other people to make appointments. Some people can only meet once a week and you have to meet them at that time to get points. But, if you’re fine with spontaneity and having to learn things on your own, you’ll be fine

Your experience will vary
It really depends on the team you’re placed with. Some teams are amazing, and some are toxic. The benefits are decent, and there’s good odds of teleworking or having flexible work hours at least some of the time. Overall, it’s a good place to work.

Awful place to work
Underpaid and overworked. Expected to work more than 40 hours but if you take over time you are piled on with more work which then means you won't meet your numbers and if you don't meet your numbers you never get a raise. The pay is horrendous and they lied about bonus pay. Additionally the salary raises are laughable. They pay poverty level wages and the salary does not equate the amount of work an stress this job provides. Training was useless, you have to learn everything on your own which takes 8-12 months. I could go on with many more reasons this company is not good but I'm too exhausted from all the work I have to do for them. I would stay away from this job. There's a reason their turn over rate is high.

Good Direct Management, Poor High-level Management
The company is alright. Culture is lacking, and not much changes occur. Very slow to catch up with the needs of the industry. Overall, the pay is on the low side as well and promotions are not considered.

Decent
Decent place to work. Rotating 24/7 schedule. Management had their favorites. Pay was reasonable but due to project creep, I decided to leave. More responsibilities yet no amazing pay increase.

Stay away
I would stay away from here. Metrics are always changing, management does not speak to you or lead you properly. If they dont like you they will find every way to make you quit.

IT work
Not a good compony to work for
BAD Managements or no Management at all, They laid
about the pay, pay cut after 3 months. The commonly is no show
Bad team work

Typical Government Contractor
Company is rudderless and has average to poor leadership. Too many levels of management and little to no strategic direction. 100% of the focus is ""make your numbers"". Tactical decisions deter long term future.

toxic work environment with constant scapegoating
their way or the highway and yet have no set standards
they have their experts spread thin across unmanageable number of projects whom you might depend on to get your job done
they are running a ux design factory, where the analysts come in towards the middle or end to write requirements based off your hard work that included the BUSINESS research and analysis
they say they are agile and have no clue what it really is
you cannot provide recommendations or suggestions, they will whittle you down
the culture is fly by the seat of your pants and all the green younger employees have drank the kook-aid

none, pto policy, but really that's my company as a subcontractor
elitist attitudes, they haven't even earned
Required To Work One Year
Let’s be clear I am not known to stick around at a job longer than a few months I like to move around especially at “throw away” jobs as I call them, I’ve been working here maybe 2 weeks so I can’t say if this is going to be a job I can’t manage but I do think I’ll be good at this and so far everybody has been helpful, the thing about signing a contract though is definitely intimidating for me, especially because the penalty for quitting before then is a high price, and the policys on if you are fired don’t seem to be as clear (just keep that in mind), they do put a lot of money into new hires however so it makes sense in a way I understand why they have that contract in place, and it seems fair to me, they provide governments furnished laptops, badges, IDs, work phones, I feel well equipped to do this job honestly and I am excited! I’ll check back in after a year.

Great Job but need hard to grasp
Great Job, unfortunately training in lacking HUGE. Supervisors dont seem to care. This is a fast pace place and it's all about the numbers. If you catch on quick great, if not it can be very difficult and stressful.

Stressful
Very stressful workplace. Poor training methods. Required to work one year with the company. Everyone has complains or things they disagree with or doesn’t make sense but are scared to speak up fearing the loss of employmen

Run!
Overworked and underpaid! No work life balance and unrealistic expectations! Insufficient training provided. Barely getting help on workload. They act like they care when they really don’t! Stay away!

Opportunity to grow
Definitely a great role for growth and to get production bonuses if metrics are met consistently. Flexibility with self-management and work life balance.

Excellent
Definitely give this company a chance they are always hiring and try to come up with ways to make people happy I am happy with my position over all great place

Great company
An amazing company, understands the military and provides a great culture. I would love to work the rest of my life at the company. They will help you with obtaining your goals and leave you in a good place for retirement.

Pretty good but underpaid engineering positions
Responsibilities can be monotonous and somewhat dull. Additionally, many seasoned engineers receive lower compensation compared to their counterparts in LM and government positions. Expect considerable pressure and stress in this environment.

Great Company
The company hire’s extremely smart people to work on very challenging projects. The people I work with are a pleasure to work with. Our site is small so work/life balance is a struggle at times

Productive and fun workplace
I enjoy my job and there are plenty of chances for advancement. The company is growing and there are many different programs that are currently hiring.

It's not what they make it out to be.
I applied for this company being told that it was a great place to work for with great benefits. However, upon being here for almost a year now, I come to find out that it's not everything that people say it is. It hurts me to even say all of this because this is the highest paying job I've had so far. Management is not very honest and upfront with you, and you don't know who's for you and against you. And the work/life balance is a lie too because they don't want you using PTO. At this point, I have considered looking for other jobs.

Not even sure
Management, pay
Good company, terrible management
NGC is a great company, if you don’t get stuck with a bad manager. The pay is decent, benefits are okay. It’s sad to see managers ruin the great reputation NGC had.

High
Nice work and great work by both the team of artists in this space to create the perfect art and to make the art more interesting to see how it is done in a

Great company, very professional.
NG is a great company to work for regardless of whether you are a seasoned professional or entry level. They started me at a generous salary and it increased regularly. I really appreciated management and their ability to balance keeping employees happy and getting the kob done.

Professional, engaging and learning work environment which kept me busy and allowed me to utilize a range of business skills and experience.
What is the best part of working at the company?
Very rewarding time in my life, colleagues were all very professional and created a camaraderie toward the projects we were involved working to complete. Good pay and benefits.


What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
There was nothing stressful about working for this company. I enjoyed all the time I spent there.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Great, they encourage growth and development as well as advancement.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
It was mainly an 8 to 5 type work day but occasionally depended on the project you were working.

Always on alert from racial comments
What is the best part of working at the company?
Played back environment good benefits package

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Some of the employees are unprofessional

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Somewhat discriminatory and separatism of Whites from other races

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Challenging and Competitive Under mining of employees

Unpleasent
Wasn’t trained properly when I first arrived, favoritism is rampant, upper management is a joke and corrupt. Employee relations never help. If you have a bad manager, you’re good as fired. Good luck.

Chill, nice people
Chill work place environment and sometimes there was no work to do. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming and the whole hiring team is the best. Could be too chill sometimes.

Overall, it is good experience, just if you tried to advance with in company, they discourage.
What is the best part of working at the company?
As an employee, and you are at contract with others, you can not move with in company, and their co-employee do not think of you as part of NG.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
no stress, all good, if the contracting company likes, NG will like you in their position as long as Contracting company likes you, that is it, no advancement.

Exciting employment
I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for Northrop Grumman. I was working in Colorado Springs while my management in Huntsville, AL. My local NG office and coworkers were great and more than willing to help. Northrop had lots of job opportunities and training to allow me to grow in my career. I met many talented, dedicated people. I would recommend Northrop Grumman to anyone seeking an exciting position with a great company.

Great pay, relaxed work environment
Was with the company 5 years. Easy to advance if you do your work and network well. Appreciated the benefits and great pay. Management was laid back and very knowledgeable. Loved it there!

Solid workplace, interesting projects, but can be slow
I've only been working here for a few months, but so far I've had a pretty positive experience. The environment is very positive, everyone (including management) treats each other well, and there is very little drama. The work is pretty interesting, but the tech stack definitely is a bit dated, but the projects are still quite complex and interesting. There can be periods where things get slow and there isn't much work, but once you're assigned to a longer term project things get better.

Great people, amazing work environment
I was working as an Intern as a mechanical design/reliability engineer.

They help you learn a lot from administrative task to technical engineering.

They were amazing people, the working environment was great.

Not a fun job, poor benefits.
They blanket affect everything and there is no accountability at work. We are given meaningless tasks to keep you busy or to punish you at work. You are given an hour break, two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute break, for a 12 hour shift. Management often pushes you to do things even after bringing up safety issues. They also force overtime and will write you up even if you have plans ahead of time.

Pay starts at $28.13 as a third operator.
Short breaks, health plan is not great compared to other businesses in the area.
challenging problems
Like any big contractor, lots of bureaucracy, but good job security.
Promotions are very by the book, early promotions are rare. The company does not realize they loose employees because the competitor down the street pays better.

Non productive and not the greatest place to work at
Great team of people to work with but a lot of the programs are not on track and no one ever knows what’s going on with these programs or the production floor. Managers are selected not what they no, but who they know! No promotion advancement within the Plant at HMC. Managers hire their friends and not from within the plant! Poor management!

Working at XYZ Company has been a rewarding journey filled with growth opportunities, a supportive work culture, and exciting challenges. The company's commitment to fostering a positive and inclusive environment is evident in every aspect of the workplace.

One of the standout aspects of XYZ Company is its emphasis on professional development. From day one, I found myself surrounded by experienced colleagues and mentors who were genuinely invested in my success. Regular training sessions, workshops, and access to online courses contributed significantly to my skill set and overall career progression.

The collaborative atmosphere at XYZ Company is another highlight. Teamwork is not just encouraged but actively cultivated, leading to a synergy that enhances productivity and creativity. The open communication channels and approachable management make it easy to share ideas and contribute to the company's success.

Accenture,"





Low salary
They don't compensate their employees enough. There is politics in workplace. Good for starting but you shouldn't stay long in this company if you want to increase your salary.

Overall great experience
With Accenture being a consulting company, the job security isn’t the strength of the company be the nature of culinsulting. Once your project comes to an end, you very well might be laid off but they do try and help find a new project. The only problem is that everyone else on your project also gets laid off, aka “on the bench” so everyone is vying for similar positions. But the benefits were great, the flexibility in my project was amazing (though I’m told many others are not, especially the government projects) and the team support and culture was unmatched based off talking with other people about their different projects.

I would definitely work for Accenture again if given the opportunity

Great simple job, but no PTO
Working a remote position through Accenture. It is a great WFH opportunity with good pay, but we do not get PTO or Sick Time at all. Also, it’s contract with so you’re job is not always guaranteed.

It's a job

Very professional company but work/life balance issues
Great, skilled people work for AFS, but there is no work/life balance. Too many departmental changes and contractors who come and go. But learned a lot here.

Great Technology knowledge base and network
Massive organisation with great technology accumen that places them in a pertinent position as digital partners for large organisation. Pay is not market leading, but great opportunities and network

Requires way too many uncompensated commitments
I don't know if this is happening to every project on Accenture, but I'm being required to work constant overtimes due to the unreasonable promises made to the clients.

As far as big companies go, it's one of the better ones
I worked at accenture for over 3 years. In that time I feel like I was treated fairly and with respect by management. I recieved 2 promotions within 3 years. I lost my job with all 250 other employees on my project with 2 weeks notice. It's a big company in the tech industry and the tech industry lost a lot of money in 2023.

Csm
Good company to work for good benefits no micromanage. management. Overall I would definitely recommend anyone to work at this establishment. Plenty of perks and benefits

Mixed Experience
As a consultant, it's a great design - you get paid the same whether or not you're currently on a project. As far as getting on a project, that often requires networking just like landing a job. You apply to what interests you, but after some time you may get placed on a project based on needs of the company. Your project determines your working hours and whether/how much you travel, and the management structure is strange (the person who advocates for your promotion is not your supervisor, and likely not even on the same project). I like the variety of projects available, but I don't like how hard it is to get a role in my desired field (software engineering).

Very tough for an experienced Sales professional
Experienced hires have a touch time at Accenture. After 1 week of training, you are encouraged to start to network yourself with long time Accenture employees. This does not work very well. The old guard at Accenture isn't incenitivized to bring on another Sales person into the mix- even if they would benefit from a specialist for the solution. They don't want to have to share a piece of the pie.
I've worked for a number of technology companies- large and small. Accenture may have been the hardest to be successful in.

good base salary and benefits
Good luck closing deals and getting commissions- the old guard keeps the best deals.
Great place to work.
What is the best part of working at the company?

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Very collaborative and supportive of each member of the team.

Tech Support specialist
Okay place to work, but somewhat rigid. Pay can be nice. For me, I didn't like being on-call for weekends, but team members were helpful nice. Lot to learn, especially in the beginning.

Good
Good company to work. Great learning opportunities, talented people.
Great work culture, no bias lot of opportunities to learn and grow.

Onsite opportunities based on project.

Training
Its been just 2 weeks that i joined
Training is going on well
Lets see how every goes ahead
They take time to solve the query if you have any . Overall

Do care about employees. You are only your ID #
Been with company MANY MANY years and people who walk in the door make more than me. No OT. No paid holidays. Expected to use PTO on holidays. So much more stuff I could say but I'm not wasting anymore time.

Great coworkers and interesting assignments
Talented co-workers and excellent training if you can get it accomplished while maintaining your billable % required. We work on all the cool projects, truth is we are passionate workaholics


na
lots of policy review, tests, quality weekly tests. if you failed quality 2 times in a month you were put under review and possible termination. alot of stress and not enough pay for the tasks at hand

lunch, drinks, team building
micromanaged
Mediocre Poor Management
During virtual training you were constantly under surveillance the training manger introduced himself and gave the new hire class an ultimatum that we were expected to participate or else while they had spies in the virtual room watching the class on camera constantly which we had to keep on at all times if we turned our cameras off they would call your manager and tell and exaggerate the truth and since it's a contract position you have no rights and if you call someone out for something they will let you go. The trainers were very unorganized and bad communication and rude and when you call them out on something they will hold it against you. In class for eight hours listening to the trainer read the text from slides did not allow any time to learn how to navigate the system and when the time came for the class to get ready to take calls no one was prepared honestly the worst training every. Trainers will try to put the blame on the class for not being prepared due to their lack of communication skills, rudeness and incompetence to prepare the class to take calls they let me go because I called out one of the rude trainers and they will let you go without notice

Nothing
Under constant pressure and surveillance
Great place to work.
Accenture is a phenomenal company and place to work. They are big into skilling up which is amazing, the ppl there are very friendly and they always are there with open arms. Downside: If cuts are to be made it happens without warning. You can be safe or out the door without any indication.

Great Team Environment
Great place to work, amazing benefits, and amazing team environment for the job being remote. I loved the fact that I could balance out my day and I never worried about anyone hovering over me.
